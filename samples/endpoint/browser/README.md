# An example of using Board Server Endpoint API directly from the Browser

To use this sample as a starting point, run [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) in a new directory:

```bash
npx degit breadboard-ai/breadboard/samples/endpoint/browser
```

To try the sample, start a simple HTTP server in that directory:

```bash
npx http-server
```

Then go to the URL provided by the server.
