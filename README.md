A library for prototyping generative AI applications.

This library was inspired by the hardware maker community and their boundless creativity. They make amazing things with off-the-shelf parts and a [breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all), just wiring things together and trying this and that until it works.

Breadboard is an attempt to bring the same spirit of creativity and simplicity to making generative AI applications.

This library's design emphasizes two key properties:

:one: **Ease and flexibility of wiring**. Make wiring prototypes easy and fun.

:two: **Modularity and composability**. Easily share, remix, reuse, and compose prototypes.

## Documentation

The documentation is a bit of a work in progress. The best place to start is the [this guide](https://breadboard-ai.github.io/breadboard/docs/happy-path/), although it is still incomplete. Please bear with us as we bring our words up to speed with our thoughts/actions.

## Monorepo

This is the monorepo for Breadboard. See [DEVELOPING.md](./DEVELOPING.md) for instructions on how to work within it.

## Requirements

Breadboard requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/) version >=v20.14.0.
