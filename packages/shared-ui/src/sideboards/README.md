The name of the sub-directory is `sideboards-bgl` because it's easier to
differentiate when mounting it as a board server when authoring sideboards.

> **Note** Currently, your edits to sideboards will NOT automatically propagate
> to the visual editor.

To bring the sideboard changes to the editor, run this command:

```sh

npm run update-sideboards

```
