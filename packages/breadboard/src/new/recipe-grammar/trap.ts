/**
 * During serialization, these will be returned on `await` on a node. If the
 * code accesses a field, it will throw an `AwaitWhileSerializing`.
 *
 * That way when an awaited async handler function returns a node, and it will
 * be returned as TrapResult, which we remember in the scope.
 *
 * But if the function itself awaits a node and reads the results, it will throw
 * an exception.
 *
 * If the function itself awaits a node and for some reason doesn't do anything
 * with it (otherwise it would trigger the exception), and returns a different
 * value or node, we'll detect that by seeing that TrapResult was set, but was
 * not returned. Such a handler function should be serialized.
 *
 * If the function doesn't return either a value or a node, i.e. just a constant
 * value, we'll for now assume that it's a non-deterministic function whose
 * output doesn't depend on the inputs and serialize it (a node that returns
 * pure values but does read from the inputs would trigger the condition above).
 *
 * TODO: Eventually though, that last case should throw an error, as all
 * external calls should be explicit (e.g. using a fetch node).
