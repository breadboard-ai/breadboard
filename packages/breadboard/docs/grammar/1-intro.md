# Introduction

[This and the following documents describe a new grammar for building
breadboards (or recipes as we call them here). It’s mostly working, but you’ll
run into bugs and gaps, so don’t depend on it just yet]

The goal of this grammar is mirrors the project’s goals:

1️⃣ Make creating recipes easy and fun, with a smooth learning curve.

2️⃣ Modularity and composability. Easily share, remix, reuse, and compose
recipes..

...

TODO: Maybe something about installing things. Recommending the `npm init` (or
analogous) path, but also offering "install as libary" (implicitly as in how
you'd add it to an existing project)

Next: [Nodes and Recipes](2-nodes-and-recipes.md)
