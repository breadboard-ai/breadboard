# Breadboard Tutorial

> [!WARNING]
> We are transitioning to new syntax and this tutorial is out of date. Please bear with us as we update it.

If you like learning by starting with simple examples that get more complex with each chapter, this guide might be a good fit.

Pre-requisites:

- Familiarity with JavaScript and Node.
- Node v19.0.0 or higher
- PaLM API key (go [here](https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup) to obtain one)
- Spirit of adventure

Each chapter is also available as a [Replit](https://replit.com/) project. Look for the "run in replit" link at the end of each chapter.

## Setup

1. Initialize your package:

   ```sh
   mkdir my-first-breadboard
   cd my-first-breadboard
   npm init --yes
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install @google-labs/breadboard @google-labs/template-starter @google-labs/palm-kit @google-labs/json-kit
   ```

   If you run into version warnings, [upgrade your node installation](https://nodejs.org).

3. Tell Node to use modern JavaScript modules by default by editing `package.json` and adding a [type](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#type) to the root:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "module"
   }
   ```

4. Add an empty file `tutorial.js`:

   ```sh
   touch tutorial.js
   ```

   For the rest of this demo you can execute that file in the terminal:

   ```sh
   node tutorial.js
   ```

## Chapter 1: Hello, world?

At the heart of the library is the concept of a `Board`. Just like for hardware makers, the `Board` is the place where wiring of a prototype happens.

To create a board:

```js
import { Board } from "@google-labs/breadboard";

const board = new Board();
```

Now that you have a board, you can place nodes on it. Think of nodes as the spiritual equivalent of hardware components that a maker might buy at the RadioShack. They are the building blocks of your application.

Let's place a node on the board:

```js
const input = board.input();
```

An `input` node is a node that asks for input from the user. It's a good place to start. Now let's place another node:

```js
const output = board.output();
```

Now we have two nodes on the board. Let's wire them together:

```js
input.wire("say->hear", output);
```

The statement above says: "take the `say` output of the `input` node and wire it to the `hear` input of the `output` node".

Every node has the `wire` method. It always takes two parameters:

- the first parameter describes what to wire, and
- the second parameter is the node that is being wired with the current node.

Now that we've wired our nodes, we can ask our breadboard to run:

```js
const result = await board.runOnce({
  say: "Hello, world?",
});
console.log("result", result);
```

When run, our tiny program will produce the following output:

```sh
result { hear: 'Hello, world?' }
```

> **🔍✨ What happened here?** The outcome should be fairly intuitive, but let's go through the process step by step:
>
> 1. The `runOnce` method of the board takes a property bag (a JS object) as its argument.
> 2. This bag of properties is then handed to the `input` node. (Why the `input` node? Because it was automatically detected as the _entrypoint_, meaning it was the only node with no nodes connected to its inputs).
> 3. The `input` node is very simple-minded: it just passes the property bag along to the next node.
> 4. This is where the wiring comes in. When we described our single wire as `say->hear`, we basically said:
>    1. reach into the property bag,
>    2. fish out the `say` property, then
>    3. pass it along to the next node as the `say` property.
> 5. Since the next node is the `output` node, that's the node that receives the `say` property.
> 6. The `output` node is also pretty simple. It takes the property bag it received and returns it as the result of the `runOnce` method.

## Chapter 2: Wiring more nodes

This is definitely a fun little program, but it's not very useful. Let's add another node to the board. This time, we need a _kit_: a collection of nodes that are bundled together for a specific purpose.

Because we're here to make generative AI applications, we'll get the [LLM Starter Kit](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/llm-starter). Breadboard works with many LLM service providers, but for this tutorial we are going to pick the [PaLM Kit](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/llm-starter) (PaLM is an LLM API from Google). You will need to get an [PaLM API Key](https://developers.generativeai.google/), save it someplace safe, and come right back.

```js
import { Board } from "@google-labs/breadboard";
import { Starter } from "@google-labs/llm-starter";
import { PaLMKit } from "@google-labs/palm-kit";

const board = new Board();
// add kits to the board
const starter = board.addKit(Starter);
const palm = board.addKit(PaLMKit);
```

The last 2 lines of the code snippet above are signficant: they each add a kit to the board. Calling the `addKit` method creates a new instance of the LLM Starter kit which is connected to our board, likewise for PaLM kit.

Now that we've added the kits, we add nodes provided by the kit to our board:

```js
const input = board.input();
const output = board.output();
const generateText = palm.generateText();
```

The `generateText` node that we've added is a node that uses the [PaLM API](https://developers.generativeai.google/) to generate text. This node takes a `text` property as an input and returns a `completion` property.

All we need to do is wire these properties to `say` and `hear` from before:

```js
input.wire("say->text", generateText);
generateText.wire("completion->hear", output);
```

Now, we have not one, but two wires on the board, connecting our three nodes. There's the `say->text` wire that connects the `input` and `generateText` nodes, and there's the `completion->hear` wire that connects the `generateText` and `output` nodes.

To make this program go, we need another node and a wire. The PaLM API behind the `generateText` node requires an API key, so we'll add a `secrets` node to the board:

```js
const secrets = core.secrets({ keys: ["PALM_KEY"] });
```

The `secrets` node reaches into our program's environment and gets the environment variable that is named `PALM_KEY`, as we specified in its argument. A `secrets` node could look for any other environment variables, we just need to specify which ones. For now, we only need the `PALM_KEY`.

We'll install and use the `dotenv` package, which conveniently reads environment variables from a `.env` file. First, install the package:

```sh
npm install dotenv
```

Next, create a `.env` file and put your API key there:

```sh
echo "PALM_KEY=\"your API key goes here\"" > .env
```

Lastly, import the `dotenv` package into your script:

```js
import { config } from "dotenv";

config();
```

With this bit of prep work out of the way, we're ready to wire the `secrets` node:

```js
secrets.wire("PALM_KEY->", generateText);
```

The statement above says: "wire `secret`'s output named `PALM_KEY` to the `generateText` input named `PALM_KEY`". Because we're wiring output to the input by the same name, we don't have to repeat ourselves.

Our second program is ready as soon as we add the `runOnce` call:

```js
const result = await board.runOnce({
  say: "Hi, how are you?",
});
console.log("result", result);
```

When run, our second program will produce output that might look something like this:

```sh
result { hear: 'Doing okay.' }
```

Oh hey! Our program is generating text using PaLM API.

You can see its source code here: [tutorial-2.js](./tutorial-2.js).

## Chatper 3: Fun with wires

So far, we've built a fairly simple board. Let's use this board to learn a bit more about convenient shortcuts and ways to wire nodes together.

First, the `wire` method returns the node itself, allowing us to wire the same node to multiple other nodes in a chain:

```js
const input = board.input();
const output = board.output();
const generateText = palm.generateText();
const secrets = core.secrets({ keys: ["PALM_KEY"] });

input.wire("say->text", generateText).wire("say->", output);
generateText.wire("completion->hear", output);
```

As you can see, we've used the chaining to add an extra wire to the `input` node. It goes straight to the `output` node, adding the `say` property to the output property bag. When we run this board, we'll see the following output:

```sh
result { say: 'Hi, how are you?', hear: 'doing okay' }
```

Second, we don't always need to create a new variable for each node. We can just create nodes as we wire them:

```js
board.input().wire("say->text", palm.generateText()).wire("say->", output);
```

Finally, we can we can wire in both directions. For example, we can wire the `secrets` node to the `generateText` node like this:

```js
generateText.wire("<-PALM_KEY", starter.secrets({ keys: ["PALM_KEY"] }));
```

Here, the arrow points in a different direction, and asks the board to wire the `PALM_KEY` output of the `secrets` node to the same input of the `generateText` node. It's equivalent to the wiring we had in the previous chapter.

Applying these newly learned techniques, we can rewrite our program like this:

```js
const output = board.output();
board
  .input()
  .wire("say->", output)
  .wire(
    "say->text",
    palm
      .generateText()
      .wire("completion->hear", output)
      .wire("<-PALM_KEY", starter.secrets({ keys: ["PALM_KEY"] }))
  );
```

It is more compact, but can be harder to read for those who are just starting to learn Breadboard. It's up to you to decide which style you prefer.

You can see the source code from this chapter here: [tutorial-3.js](./tutorial-3.js).

## Chapter 4: Saving, loading, and visualizing boards

Once the board is created, it can be used by the program that made it. But what if we want to reuse the board we made?

Conveniently, boards are serializable as JSON:

```js
const json = JSON.stringify(board);
```

Or, with better formatting:

```js
const json = JSON.stringify(board, null, 2);
```

The resulting JSON string can be trivially saved into a file:

```js
import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";

await writeFile("/path/to/board.json", json);
```

We can then load the serialized board from a file with `Board.load`:

```js
const board2 = await Board.load("/path/to/board.json");
```

Once we have the new board loaded, we can run it (note that the kits that the loaded board depends on
as well as the secrets it needs must now be provided):

```js
import { Board, asRuntimeKit } from "@google-labs/breadboard";
import { Starter } from "@google-labs/llm-starter";
import { PaLMKit } from "@google-labs/palm-kit";
import { config } from "dotenv";

config();

const result = await board2.runOnce(
  { say: "Hi, how are you?" },
  { kits: [asRuntimeKit(Starter), asRuntimeKit(PaLMKit)] }
);

console.log("result", result);
```

And get the output like:

```sh
result { say: 'Hi, how are you?', hear: 'Doing alright.' }
```

Saving and loading boards means that we can now share the boards with others outside of the programs we wrote, and that creates all kind of interesting possibilities.

As the capstone for this chapter, let's draw some diagrams. Every board can be turned into a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram. All we need to do is call the `mermaid` method:

```js
const diagram = board2.mermaid();
console.log(diagram);
```

Running the program produces this:

```
%%{init: 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'Fira Code, monospace' }}%%
graph TD;
input2[/"input
id='input-2'"/]:::input -- "say->say" --> output1{{"output
id='output-1'"}}:::output
generateText3["text-completion
id='text-completion-3'"] -- "completion->hear" --> output1{{"output
id='output-1'"}}:::output
secrets4("secrets
id='secrets-4'"):::secrets -- "PALM_KEY->PALM_KEY" --> generateText3["text-completion
id='text-completion-3'"]
input2[/"input
id='input-2'"/]:::input -- "say->text" --> generateText3["text-completion
id='text-completion-3'"]
keyssecrets4[keys]:::config -- "keys->keys" --o secrets4
classDef default stroke:#ffab40,fill:#fff2ccff,color:#000
classDef input stroke:#3c78d8,fill:#c9daf8ff,color:#000
classDef output stroke:#38761d,fill:#b6d7a8ff,color:#000
classDef passthrough stroke:#a64d79,fill:#ead1dcff,color:#000
classDef slot stroke:#a64d79,fill:#ead1dcff,color:#000

classDef secrets stroke:#db4437,fill:#f4cccc,color:#000
classDef slotted stroke:#a64d79
```

Which, when viewed with Mermaid looks like this:

```mermaid
%%{init: 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'Fira Code, monospace' }}%%
graph TD;
input2[/"input
id='input-2'"/]:::input -- "say->say" --> output1{{"output
id='output-1'"}}:::output
generateText3["text-completion
id='text-completion-3'"] -- "completion->hear" --> output1{{"output
id='output-1'"}}:::output
secrets4("secrets
id='secrets-4'"):::secrets -- "PALM_KEY->PALM_KEY" --> generateText3["text-completion
id='text-completion-3'"]
input2[/"input
id='input-2'"/]:::input -- "say->text" --> generateText3["text-completion
id='text-completion-3'"]
keyssecrets4[keys]:::config -- "keys->keys" --o secrets4
classDef default stroke:#ffab40,fill:#fff2ccff,color:#000
classDef input stroke:#3c78d8,fill:#c9daf8ff,color:#000
classDef output stroke:#38761d,fill:#b6d7a8ff,color:#000
classDef passthrough stroke:#a64d79,fill:#ead1dcff,color:#000
classDef slot stroke:#a64d79,fill:#ead1dcff,color:#000
classDef config stroke:#a64d79,fill:#ead1dcff,color:#000
classDef secrets stroke:#db4437,fill:#f4cccc,color:#000
classDef slotted stroke:#a64d79
```

You can generate an SVG or other kind of image using [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli). Github Markdown also has great support for Mermaid. Just paste the Mermaid output as code into the doc as source code marked as `mermaid`:

````markdown
```mermaid
<put Mermaid code here>
```
````

## Chapter 5: Including other boards

In addition to loading saved boards, we can also include them into our board. For this, we need the `include` node, which acts as a sort of instant board-to-node converter: just give it the URL of a serialized board, and it will pretend as if that whole board is just one node.

For example, let's suppose our friend built this really neat board that summarizes latest news on a topic. We supply the topic as input, and get summary as output. The board takes in an input of `topic`, and when run, outputs `headlines`.

Our friend published their board's JSON at this URL:

```js
const NEWS_BOARD_URL =
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/main/packages/breadboard/docs/tutorial/google-news-headlines.json";
```

We can _include_ their board using the `include` node from the
[Core Kit](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/core-kit),
which you may need to install:

```sh
npm install @google-labs/core-kit
```

Import the Core module, add the kit to the board, and then wire `core.include({ path: NEWS_BOARD_URL })` as a new node in our board.
In this case we are wiring `topic` into the included news board and the `headlines` it returns are wired into `hear` on our output:

```js
import { Core } from "@google-labs/core-kit";

const core = board.addKit(Core);

board
  .input()
  .wire(
    "say->topic",
    core
      .include({ path: NEWS_BOARD_URL })
      .wire("headlines->hear", board.output())
  );
```

So when we run our board:

```js
const result = await board.runOnce({ say: "Latest news on breadboards" });
console.log("result", result);
```

... we'll get a response that looks something like this:

```js
result {

}
```

Let's add a few more nodes to the board which will use a LLM to summarize news on a given topic.

First, we'll need a prompt that combines the topic we've provided, the headlines produced by our friend's board, and some instructions on what to do with them. To do that, we'll use the `promptTemplate` node from the [LLM Starter Kit](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/llm-starter):

```js
const template = starter.promptTemplate({
  template:
    "Use the news headlines below to write a few sentences to " +
    "summarize the latest news on this topic:\n\n##Topic:\n" +
    "{{topic}}\n\n## Headlines\n{{headlines}}\n\n## Summary:\n",
});
```

The `promptTemplate` node takes a `template` string in its argument object. The template string is a string that can contain placeholders. The placeholders are enclosed in double curly braces, like this: `{{placeholder}}`. The node replaces placholders with the values of the properties that are passed to it.

So, in the code snippet above, this node needs to have these two properties wired into it: `topic` and `headlines`.

Additionally, we'll wire up the `generateText` node that we've learned about in Chapter 2:

```js
const input = board.input();
input.wire(
  "say->topic",
  core.include({ path: NEWS_BOARD_URL }).wire(
    "headlines->",
    template.wire("topic<-say", input).wire(
      "prompt->text",
      palm
        .generateText()
        .wire("<-PALM_KEY.", starter.secrets({ keys: ["PALM_KEY"] }))
        .wire("completion->say", board.output())
    )
  )
);
```

You can see the `template` node gets `topic` and `headlines` as inputs and returns a `prompt` string which is wired as the `text` input to `palm.generateText()`.

After these changes, running our board produces a nice, concise summary:

```sh
result {
  say: 'The latest news on breadboards include a new jumperless breadboard, a 486 computer built on a breadboard, and micro mercury trapped ion clock prototypes.'
}
```

You can see the source code for this chapter here: [tutorial-5.js](./tutorial-5.js).

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/run%20in%20replit-chapter_5-orange?logo=replit "run in replit: chapter 5")](https://replit.com/@dglazkov/Breadboard-Tutorial-Chapter-5)

## Chapter 6: Boards with slots

Including other boards is nifty, since it allows us to build modular boards. However, sometimes we wish could leave a place in the board where anyone could insert other boards. Programmers call it "dependency injection".

In Breadboard, these places are called "slots", and there's a special node (helpfully called `slot`) that we can use to create slots.

For instance, let's take our example from Chapter 5 and imagine that we showed the resulting board to our friend and they really liked the summarizer bit. Awesome! However, they are still playing with the different ways to get the news headlines. They have a few different boards they'd like to use with this summarizer.

In this case, what we need is a board with a slot: instead of including our friend's board like we did in a previous example, we need to leave room to insert any board -- so that our friend could experiment with all the cool news source-gathering boards that they're tinkering with.

Let's see if we can make something like that. First, we'll need to prepare the board with a slot. This part is fairly straightforward. Instead of using the `include` node, we replace it with the `slot` node:

```diff
-   core.include({ path: NEWS_BOARD_URL }).wire(
+   board.slot({ slot: "news" }).wire(
```

We will end up with the board that looks like something like this:

```js
const input = board.input();
input.wire(
  "topic->",
  core.slot({ slot: "news" }).wire(
    "headlines->",
    template.wire("topic<-", input).wire(
      "prompt->text",
      palm
        .generateText()
        .wire("<-PALM_KEY.", starter.secrets({ keys: ["PALM_KEY"] }))
        .wire("completion->summary", board.output())
    )
  )
);
```

Note that we've tweaked the input and output to make them more descriptive. It's a nice thing to do when handing our own boards to our friends. The board now takes `topic` as the input and returns `summary` as the output.

If we try to run this board now, we'll get an error:

```
Error: No graph found for slot "news"
```

This is expected. Our board has an empty slot. Without a board being slotted into it, this board can't run.

As the next step, we share the board with our friend. The best way to do this is to save it as a json file and then put it somewhere our friend can access:

```js
const json = JSON.stringify(board, null, 2);
await writeFile("./docs/tutorial/news-summarizer.json", json);
```

Suppose we published it at this URL:

```js
const NEWS_SUMMARIZER_URL =
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/main/packages/breadboard/docs/tutorial/news-summarizer.json";
```

Now, when our friend wants to use this board, they need to do something like this. Load their newsboard:

```js
const NEWS_BOARD_URL =
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/main/packages/breadboard/docs/tutorial/google-news-headlines.json";

const news = await Board.load(NEWS_BOARD_URL);
```

Then load our summarizer board, with the newsboard slotted in:

```js
const board = await Board.load(NEWS_SUMMARIZER_URL, { slotted: { news } });
```

When run, the board will now produce expected results! These lines:

```js
const result = await board.runOnce(
  { topic: "Latest news on breadboards" },
  { kits: [asRuntimeKit(Core), asRuntimeKit(Starter), asRuntimeKit(PaLMKit)] }
);
console.log("result", result);
```

Will give us output like this:

```sh
result {
  summary: 'The latest news on breadboards include a new jumperless breadboard, a programmable precision resistor, and a 486 computer built on a breadboard. In addition, there are new developments in the field of flexible and rapid prototyping of electronic devices.'
}
```

Our friend is thrilled! To try a different board, all they need to do is supply a different `NEWS_BOARD_URL`. What's even cooler is that our workflows are decoupled. We can keep improving the summarizer and publishing better iterations. As long as the URL stays the same and input/outputs stay the same, our friend's contraption will keep on working.

## Chapter 7: Probes

Let's explore another useful tool that is available in Breadboard. The `LogProbe` is a simple way to peek into what's happening in the Breadboard.

Using `LogProbe` is fairly simple. Just add it as an extra parameter to `runOnce`:

```js
import { Board, LogProbe } from "@google-labs/breadboard";

// ...

const result = await board.runOnce(
  {
    say: "Hi, how are you?",
  },
  undefined,
  new LogProbe()
);
console.log("result", result);
```

Now, in addition to printing the results, we will see a bunch of extra text in the console. Like this:

```sh
input {
  descriptor: { id: 'input-2', type: 'input' },
  inputs: {},
  outputs: { say: 'Hi, how are you?' }
}
node {
  descriptor: {
    id: 'secrets-4',
    type: 'secrets',
    configuration: { keys: [Array] }
  },
  inputs: { keys: [ 'PALM_KEY' ] },
  outputs: { PALM_KEY: '<key here>' },
  validatorMetadata: []
}
skip {
  descriptor: { id: 'output-1', type: 'output' },
  inputs: { say: 'Hi, how are you?' },
  missingInputs: [ 'hear' ]
}
```

This text represents the actual steps that the board is taking to run. Each step has the same format:

```sh
event {
  data
}
```

There are four different kinds of events:

- `input` -- this is printed when an `input` node is visited. As data, the probe will print out the internal representation of the node known as `descriptor`, as well as `inputs` and `outputs` for the input node.
- `output` -- same, but for the `output` node.
- `node` -- same, but for all other kinds of nodes.
- `skip` -- this event happens when a node does not yet have the data for all its inputs. As data, the probe will supply `missingInputs`, which is a list of inputs that haven't yet been supplied by other nodes to visit this node.

These events give us a pretty good way to see what's happening. By studying the `input` and `output` fields of each event, we can see what is being passed. Very commonly, this shows us our mistakes of passing the wrong data or passing data to the wrong node.

By itself, `skip` event is not a bad thing. It's just an indicator that the board is looking at possible candidates for the next node to visit, and this candidate isn't yet ready (`missingInputs` will tell you why). However, the `skip` event can be very handy when troubleshooting boards that return nothing. Usually, the last statement in such a board will be a `skip` event indicating which inputs were missing. This is a decent way to find typos in our wiring.

The `LogProbe` is just one kind of a probe that can be inserted into the board. You can make your own. To make your own probe, just use a built-in `EventTarget` class (available in both Node 19+ and as a Web API):

```js
const probe = new EventTarget();
```

Then, listen to any of the events above. For instance, let's make a simple probe that picks out the output of `generateText` node and prints it every time that node is run:

```js
probe.addEventListener("node", (event) => {
  const data = event.detail;
  if (data.descriptor.type == "palm-generateText") {
    console.log("completion:", data.outputs.completion);
  }
});
```

Now, when we use this probe and run our board:

```js
const result = await board.runOnce({ say: "Hi, how are you?" }, { probe });
console.log("result", result);
```

We will get this result:

```sh
completion: Hello, I am doing well. How are you?
result {
  say: 'Hi, how are you?',
  hear: 'Hello, I am doing well. How are you?'
}
```

## Chapter 8: Continuous runs

If all the while you were wondering why the method to run a board is called `runOnce` ("once"? why just once?!), this chapter has the answers.

Boards can have multiple `input` and `output` nodes, and these nodes can be visited more than once. For example, we might have a chat bot that carries a multi-turn conversation with the user or another bot. To enable such scenarios, boards have the `run` method. This method is what's called an [asynchronous generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncGenerator). It's typically used like this:

```js
for await (const stop of board.run()) {
  // do something with `stop`
}
```

A good way to think of what the code above describes is that when we ask the board to run, it will occasionally pause and give us a chance to interact with it.

The two particular occasions that the board pauses for are to ask for inputs and to provide outputs. To find out why the board stopped, we check for the `type` property on `stop`:

```js
for await (const stop of board.run()) {
  if (stop.type === "input") {
    // board is asking us to provide input
  } else if (stop.type === "output") {
    // board is providing output
  }
}
```

For example, if we take this simple board:

```js
const output = board.output();
board.input().wire(
  "say->text",
  palm
    .generateText()
    .wire("completion->hear", output)
    .wire("<-PALM_KEY", starter.secrets({ keys: ["PALM_KEY"] }))
);
```

We can make it run using the `run` method like so:

```js
for await (const stop of board.run()) {
  if (stop.type === "input") {
    stop.inputs = { say: "Hi, how are you?" };
  } else if (stop.type === "output") {
    console.log("result", stop.outputs);
  }
}
```

If our board only has outputs that are visited once, we don't need to write all this code. This is why `runOnce` method exists. It exits after receiving the first output.

See the source code for this chapter: [tutorial-8.js](./tutorial-8.js).

## Chapter 9: Let's build a chat bot.

However, what if we want to keep going? Let's build a very, very simple chat bot. Unlike in previous chapters, here we'll make a tiny, yet full-fledged program, so we'll need a few more JavaScript imports than usual:

```js
import readline from "node:readline/promises";
import { stdin, stdout } from "node:process";

import { config } from "dotenv";

import { Board } from "@google-labs/breadboard";
import { Starter } from "@google-labs/llm-starter";
```

The first two lines give us just enough bits to add the simplest possible interactivity: asking program user for input.

Now, let's create a new board, add the [LLM Starter Kit](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/llm-starter) and the [PaLM Kit](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/llm-starter) and load the `.env` variables, just like we did in Chapter 2.

```js
config();

const board = new Board();
const core = board.addKit(Core);
const starter = board.addKit(Starter);
const palm = board.addKit(PaLMKit);
```

We are ready to place some nodes on the board. Let's start with `input` and `output`. Since we already know that we're building a chat bot that looks for input right after producing the output, we'll go ahead and wire `output` right back to `input`:

```js
const input = board.input();
const output = board.output();
output.wire("->", input);
```

This wiring above is new to this tutorial, since it doesn't have the familiar property name in it. It's a control-only wire. It does not pass any data, just tells the board to visit `input` after `output`.

Next, let's add some way to store the history of the conversation between the user and our chat bot. To do this, we'll need the `append` node from the [Core Kit](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/core-kit):

```js
const history = core.append();
history.wire("accumulator->?", history);
input.wire("say->user", history);
```

There's a lot of power stuffed into this little snippet. Let's unpack it.

Though introduced so late in the tutorial, the `append` node is probably the most versatile power tool in the [Core Kit](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/core-kit).

What it does is deceptively simple: the `append` node looks for an input property named `accumulator`, then appends the rest of the input properties to it, and then returns the result as the output property named `accumulator`. It _accumulates_, get it?

In its simplest form, the append node accumulates values as multi-line text, formatting each input property as `{{property_name}}: {{proprety_value}}`.

This accumulation bit can go a very long way. For example, consider this line:

```js
history.wire("accumulator->", history);
```

When we wire the `accumulator` back into itself, it will just keep on growing every time this node is visited, with all additional inputs added as a list.

However, what happens when we try to visit it for the first time and there's no `accumulator` property yet? We need a way to somehow signal to Breadboard that it's okay to visit the node.

This is where the "`?`" modifier comes in. It tells Breadboard to treat the wire as **optional** and feel free to visit this node even if the `accumulator` property hasn't yet been provided as input. Use this modifier with caution, since it can lead to unintended arbitrary node visits.

Such wiring allows us to create a running list of the interactions between the user and the chat bot. The last line in the code snippet above says: "append the value of the `say` property to the end of your list as `user: {{value}}`.

As the next step, let's place and wire the `generateText` node:

```js
const completion = palm
  .generateText()
  .wire("completion->hear", output)
  .wire("completion->assistant", history)
  .wire("<-PALM_KEY.", starter.secrets({ keys: ["PALM_KEY"] }));
```

Let's look at this node's wiring. The first two make sense. We want the result of text completion to go to output, and we want it in the conversation history. The third one is also familiar, but it has a weird dot (`.`) at the end. What is that?

The dot signifies that this wire is a constant. It remembers the last value passed through it and makes it always available to the receiving node. It's important here, because otherwise, we'd have to find ways to visit the `secrets` node on every cycle of the loop.

So we have the `generateText` node all set up. But what's the prompt that goes into it? To create a prompt, we need a `promptTemplate` node. Let's place and wire it:

```js
starter
  .promptTemplate({
    template:
      "This is a conversation between a friendly assistant and their user.\n" +
      "You are the assistant and your job is to try to be helpful,\n" +
      "empathetic, and fun.\n\n" +
      "== Conversation History\n" +
      "{{context}}\n\n" +
      "== Current Conversation\n" +
      "user: {{question}}\n" +
      "assistant:",
    context: "",
  })
  .wire("prompt->text", completion)
  .wire("question<-say", input)
  .wire("context<-accumulator", history);
```

The first two wires connect the template to completion and the input to template.

The third one wires the `accumulator` input to the `context` template placeholder, so that the history we accumulated with the `append` node shows up in the template.

There's also a little trick here in how we configure the `promptTemplate` node. See how we pass an object with a single property `context` as the second argument to the `promptTemplate` constructor? This is how we provide the inital value for the `context` palceholder. When this node is visited the first time, it won't yet have any of the conversation history, so we'll need something (an empty string in this case) to put into the placeholder.

Alright! Do we have everything we need?

If we try to run the board now, it will simply exit without doing anything. We're missing one more piece of the puzzle: the entry point that leads to the initial `input` node.

Here's how to think about it. Prior to running, a board collects entry nodes. These are the nodes that have no wires coming into them. These are the nodes that the board begins visiting first.

In all of the previous chapters, the `input` node was the natural entry point. There were no wires coming into it. This changed when we added the wire that connected the `output` back to `input`. With this addition, the `input` node is no longer considered to be an entry node -- it has a wire from `output` coming into it.

How do we fix that? It's actually fairly easy. We employ a handy node called `passthrough`. The `passthrough` node is the simplest of them all. It literally just passes its inputs to its outputs. Every computer needs a no-op node, and Breadboard is no exception.

All we need to do is place this `passthrough` node on the board and wire it to the input:

```js
core.passthrough().wire("->", input);
```

Now, when the board runs, it will see this `passthrough` node as the entry, and will make its way to the `input`, starting the chat bot cycle.

Okay. We have a working board. We'll still need to write a few more lines of plumbing to turn it into a chat bot program.

Prepare the `readline` interface so that the program can ask the user questions, and print out a welcoming preamble:

```js
const ask = readline.createInterface({ input: stdin, output: stdout });
console.log("Hello! I'm your friendly assistant. How can I help you today?");
console.log("Type 'exit' to end conversation.");
```

Use the continuous run pattern we've learned in the previous chapter:

```js
for await (const stop of board.run()) {
  if (stop.type === "input") {
    const say = await ask.question("> ");
    if (say === "exit") break;
    stop.inputs = { say };
  } else if (stop.type === "output") {
    console.log(stop.outputs.hear);
  }
}
```

Note that because the board stops for us, we have the power to break out of the cycle. Here, we simply check for `exit` as the input, but I hope this gives you ideas on how to make continuously-run boards where you retain control of when to stop a run.

Finally, close the `readline` interface.

```js
ask.close();
```

Now, when we run the program we wrote, we'll see something like this:

```diff
Hello! I'm your friendly assistant. How can I help you today?
Type 'exit' to end conversation.
> I am hungry
Where would you like to eat?
> Somewhere cozy
What about The Cozy Cafe?
> ooh, that sounds great!
Great! What would you like to order?
> a burger with fries
Got it. And what would you like to drink?
> ginger ale
Perfect. And what size would you like?
> extra large
Okay, so a large burger with fries and a large ginger ale. Anything else?
> that's it, thank you
```

Congrats! We made us a bot.
