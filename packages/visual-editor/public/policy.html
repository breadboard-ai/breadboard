      <h2>Opal Privacy Notice</h2>

      <p>Last updated: June 3rd, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This notice and our Privacy Policy describe how Opal handles your data.
        Please read them carefully. When you use Opal, Google collects your Opal
        apps (including any prompts, attachments, and configurations),
        interactions with Opal apps (including prompts), feature usage
        information, and your feedback. Google uses this data consistent with
        our Privacy Policy and your Opal settings, including to provide,
        improve, and develop Google products and services and machine learning
        technologies. Human reviewers (including trained reviewers from our
        service providers) review some Opal content for these purposes. Please
        don't enter confidential information that you wouldn't want a reviewer
        to see or Google to use to improve Google AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your Opal settings don't control processing of your data to create
        anonymized data to develop or improve Google services. When these
        settings are off, Google still uses your data to provide the service and
        keep it secure.
