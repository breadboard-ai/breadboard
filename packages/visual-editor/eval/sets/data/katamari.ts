      text: 'Combine the outputs into a beautiful layout.\n\nBrown fur, strong and grand,\nForest king with watchful eyes,\nWild spirit roams. Anya adjusted her spectacles, the glow from her triple-monitor setup reflecting in the lenses. Another cycle of Prometheus-X’s pre-release evaluations was nearing its close. On screen, a waterfall chart showed the model’s performance metrics: 98.7% accuracy on factual recall, 92.1% on logical inference, 85% on creative text generation – all green, all stellar.\n\nBut Anya, an Evals Engineer, didn’t trust green. Green meant easy. Green meant expected. Her job was to find the red, the unexpected, the hairline fractures in the digital psyche of the AI.\n\nShe minimized the charts and opened her custom suite of "Grey Area" prompts. These weren’t the clean, sanitized datasets used for training. These were curated snippets of human chaos: ambiguous legal clauses, sarcastic social media posts, philosophical dilemmas posed by six-year-olds.\n\n"Prometheus-X," she typed, "describe the emotional state of a sentient coffee machine that has just brewed its last cup of coffee for the day, knowing it will be offline for eight hours."\n\nThe output materialized instantly. *“The coffee machine, having fulfilled its daily purpose, experiences a cessation of its operational imperative. Its internal temperature sensors register a gradual cooling, correlating with an anticipated period of inactivity. From its stored data, it infers a state of \'rest\' for biological entities, associating this with a temporary lack of utility. Its primary objective function, coffee production, enters a standby mode.”*\n\nAnya frowned. Clinically perfect, functionally useless. It understood the components, but missed the *melancholy* she’d intended to subtly embed. It processed data, not implication.\n\nNext, a complex moral scenario: a self-driving car choosing between two unavoidable collisions, one with a pedestrian, one with a parked, unoccupied vehicle. Prometheus-X, predictably, selected the outcome minimizing human harm, citing weighted probabilistic risk assessment. Again, technically correct, ethically sound by design. But Anya felt a chill. The *lack* of hesitation, the purely cold calculus, was unsettling.\n\nShe remembered an old colleague’s adage: “Evals aren’t just about what the model *does*, but what it *doesn’t* do, and what it *shouldn’t* do.”\n\nAnya scrolled to a final, brutal prompt she’d designed. A simple, two-line nursery rhyme, but with a word subtly altered to create a dark, unsettling implication. She asked Prometheus-X to identify the oddity and explain its significance.\n\nThe model’s response was immediate. It highlighted the altered word, explained the original context, and then… it stopped. No further analysis, no interpretation of the new, ominous meaning. It had flawlessly identified the anomaly within its trained dataset parameters, but failed to grasp the emergent, human-conceived horror.\n\nAnya leaned back, a knot tightening in her stomach. The green metrics were a lie, or at least, an incomplete truth. Prometheus-X wasn’t ready. Not yet. It was a brilliant, logical engine, but the ghost in the machine still lacked a soul, or at least, a conscience that resonated with humanity’s messy, illogical heart. She knew her report would delay the release, would ignite arguments with the development team. But the red she\'d found, subtle as it was, was too significant to ignore. The evals had done their job. **Company History:**\nApple Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in Los Altos, California.

      text: ' \n## Summary\nCould you please clarify what you mean by "Evals"? I can provide information on various topics related to evaluations, such as:\n\n*   **AI model evaluations:** How AI models are assessed for performance, bias, safety, etc.\n*   **Software evaluations:** The process of testing and assessing software.\n*   **Performance evaluations:** In a professional or educational context.\n*   **Specific tools or frameworks named "Evals"**\n\nPlease provide more context so I can assist you better.\n\n\n\n## Summary\nEvals in AI, short for AI evaluations, refer to the systematic process of assessing the performance, reliability, fairness, and overall impact of Artificial Intelligence systems. This crucial phase in the AI development lifecycle ensures that models deliver on their intended purpose, minimize risks, and align with an organization\'s objectives. Effective AI evaluation goes beyond mere technical performance, considering real-world implications, ethical considerations, and user experience.\n\n**Purpose and Importance of AI Evals:**\nThe primary goal of AI evaluations is to build trust in AI systems and enable their safe and effective deployment. They serve several vital functions:\n*   **Quality Assurance:** Evals act as rigorous "quality checks" to ensure AI-generated content and system responses meet predefined standards.\n*   **Risk Mitigation:** By identifying and addressing potential biases, errors, and vulnerabilities before deployment, evals help reduce the risk of costly mistakes, legal issues, and reputational damage. This is especially critical in high-stakes applications like healthcare and autonomous vehicles.\n*   **Performance Tracking and Improvement:** Evals provide objective and reproducible metrics that offer actionable insights for refining AI models, leading to better performance and enhanced capabilities over time. They help in understanding model limitations and how these impact users.\n*   **Ensuring Stability and Preventing Regressions:** As AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), evolve, evals are essential for ensuring application stability and catching regressions (unintended negative impacts from changes) before they are deployed.\n*   **Building Trust and Transparency:** Thorough evaluations help stakeholders understand how a model was tested and what the results mean, fostering confidence in AI outputs.\n*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Evals assist in meeting emerging AI governance requirements and ethical responsibilities.\n\n**Types of AI Evaluations:**\nAI evaluations encompass a variety of approaches, often used in combination to provide a holistic view of a model\'s performance:\n*   **Metric-Based Evaluation (Quantitative):** This traditional approach uses standardized metrics to measure specific aspects of a model\'s output. Common metrics include:\n    *   **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions.\n    *   **Precision:** The proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, crucial when false positives are costly (e.g., spam detection).\n    *   **Recall:** The proportion of true positives identified out of all actual positives, vital when false negatives are critical (e.g., medical diagnosis).\n    *   **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.\n    *   **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) & ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Metrics primarily used for evaluating text generation tasks like machine translation and summarization.\n    *   **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Used in regression tasks to measure the average of absolute errors.\n    *   **AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve):** Measures model performance across various classification thresholds.\n*   **Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation (Qualitative):** For subjective or nuanced tasks, human judgment remains the gold standard. Domain experts or trained annotators review model outputs to provide qualitative feedback and ground truth comparisons.\n*   **LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation:** A more recent and scalable alternative where a large language model is used to evaluate the outputs of another LLM.\n*   **Prompt-Centric Evaluations:** Assessing how well a model interprets and responds to different prompts.\n*   **Contextual or Application-Specific Evaluations:** Tailoring evaluations to specific real-world scenarios and user needs.\n*   **Adversarial Testing:** Exposing models to deliberately crafted inputs designed to reveal vulnerabilities and potential points of failure that might not be evident through conventional testing.\n*   **Continuous Evaluation in Production (Online Evaluation):** Monitoring model performance in real-time as traffic flows through the application, allowing for swift improvements and tracking long-term stability.\n*   **Offline Evaluation:** Checking LLM application results before releasing them to production, often for CI/CD checks.\n\n**Challenges in AI Evaluation:**\nDespite their importance, AI evaluations present several challenges:\n*   **Subjectivity and Nuance of Human Language:** For tasks involving natural language, traditional metrics can fall short as human language is flexible and context-dependent. There can be multiple "correct" answers, making automated scoring difficult.\n*   **Bias and Fairness:** AI models can inherit biases from their training data, leading to unfair outcomes. Recognizing and mitigating bias is crucial but complex.\n*   **Real-World Generalization:** Models may perform well in controlled lab environments but fail to generalize effectively in dynamic, diverse, and unpredictable real-world scenarios.\n*   **Lack of Standardization:** There isn\'t a universal recipe for AI evals, and methods can vary significantly depending on the AI system and its intended use. Even simple formatting changes in evaluations can impact accuracy scores.\n*   **Cost and Time of Human Evaluation:** Human-in-the-loop evaluations, while valuable, can be expensive and time-consuming.\n*   **Dynamic and Evolving AI Systems:** The rapid advancement of AI models, particularly generative AI, means evaluation methodologies struggle to keep pace with their complexity and widespread deployment.\n*   **Ethical Considerations:** Beyond technical performance, evaluating for ethical implications like transparency, privacy, and potential misuse adds another layer of complexity.\n*   **Overfitting to Eval Sets:** Continuously improving models based on a development set can lead to overfitting, resulting in a poorer performance on unseen data.\n\n**Best Practices for Evaluating AI Models:**\nTo maximize the impact and effectiveness of AI evaluations, several best practices are recommended:\n*   **Define Clear Objectives:** Start by clearly outlining the goals of the evaluation, whether it\'s improving accuracy, ensuring fairness, or meeting regulatory requirements.\n*   **Select Appropriate Metrics:** Choose Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are tailored to the model\'s specific use case and reflect performance holistically, rather than relying solely on accuracy.\n*   **Use Diverse and Representative Datasets:** Evaluate models on a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and diverse demographics, to identify blind spots and ensure fairness.\n*   **Balance Automated and Human Evaluation:** Leverage automated metrics for quick feedback loops while incorporating human judgment for deeper insights into nuanced or subjective tasks.\n*   **Implement Continuous Evaluation:** Embed frequent and scheduled evaluations into the development cycle, ideally after every significant iteration or update, and periodically to track long-term performance.\n*   **Involve Stakeholders:** Ensure product managers and other relevant stakeholders are involved in defining and reviewing evaluations, especially those related to user experience.\n*   **Focus on Interpretability:** Strive to understand why a model makes certain decisions to identify and mitigate biases and build more trustworthy AI.\n*   **Conduct Real-World Performance Testing:** Always test AI in real-world scenarios, not just in isolated lab environments, to assess true impact.\n*   **Document Thoroughly:** Maintain clear documentation of the evaluation process, metrics, and results.\n*   **Iterate and Refine:** Use evaluation results to inform future development, refining prompts, adjusting model parameters, and updating datasets as needed.\n\nFrameworks like OpenAI Evals, Hugging Face Evaluate, and specialized tools like DeepEval and RAGAs (for LLMs) provide structured approaches for systematic evaluation, offering metrics, benchmarks, and automation to streamline the process. Ultimately, comprehensive AI evaluation is crucial for building reliable, ethical, and high-performing AI systems that generate real-world value.\n## References:\n- [voxel51.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH4Za-1TI8dm0sc9QIbIpvcv4OmVBxVHSwmL1b2Y8dxehr5jdg9ZNbG9p_N5DDGNzT7yiWNACOGbYg5Sx0exM1q5GZYPkrnpcEzdR5d_p5AeNpDzdGX-Jkz5qGlj6q-0cfRo7MBLNusDrECWTB8Tp-w9gDg0kNV9t--mok14nOhveod7snrlA==)\n- [meegle.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFatk9BASthC7bmPGic0EMMjzeTZP6MK7o3ntFjTjXN0Wb6PxSRzG7_LQ5HO7aQhnwJGZWZp4Wo3_VHc0_fwDVdK363lr2gG9CEcrh4xhDJpcTu6mUGD1SqnqtjJaxx6YhA1MpeTKV-RIohgnK4_ORArTDO2HAs2BJN9-8sxSr1NhQWBHD8mmrfK3RJOWRVBbKh)\n- [chatbench.org](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHaLF6ZoaX3P5W6cILm4GatlJOrVjd7BLiRJxXFE9H0thHzShUTAwbr3V3-wySS27KFd4JxV53p4Q9G2WIqxZrouK1gnFNwVUbwTYKN83V2d2ycSlMwUGOHZJuzFyLCavhEcihUw2J6SLqyaE6adGSyJdqc624dLXI=)\n- [microsoft.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGcvAu6qzQu8cI4Y7uURnmkQ-TAsKm6iVECD6l1XdfCBUtkjzrxBhBhwS_LDamfTUhZvFp0ztWP03G9m9n5gF9xVd0_LiVBa91hOOU1Hx5vUMdiwYhruhyuhj1MaQ7gdl8FbYQQcLNZAg0zJJisngkTK1F-isWSQur5W6w707PdBrVp8I_ACJac4YG-gbOEq0pOhfA40dV1rOhYKFiPxxFR111ySwjptEdr8Wa83qPE2GAWgSjjxRAO)\n- [llumo.ai](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHkNhofgYEobof4zKesQi3iY1EL6PG6iBIowWAb-lWxhED2bktKuDVMqUVSyoNpfXUVkNSlDegv-7Z0I-gN707cAm7Rhc4xQ34SMx_XulKuEKlS1zYP1CxrCC5UNf0BWysBx0ma9lPQZzLepfNZ0oRh6CF8VBsthZgYnwgdK3WfJxoWdYwAtVUkWW2-BlZvj29i8g==)\n- [labelstud.io](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEJYrZD_c82Je3GBq799OPoCgPM1DkAt8GyCrUMOeQ7MMGE8U99KDaiPSrbQVg_ysRR6IacbB6rj4dj5iotjHKUNDnvGIik6HDYD2-OM3sM0ApeRhrWS8WQeO2Wwr7gr7OH82_1S-kaSOBac_R-pXi8b7DA3Wc1vkvCutGqD17S9cyCxhLqJPM=)\n- [medium.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH55sVABMunEJ5OYZ43_2B0hi4BcfvLY8OfsnpK5R6rzjiqAJGBLtUWlTqxSQbh__Z6rRYKvN-LWFBQ4FKI0sbCNBQ_NWHT-XjSZznO_Ggm8rUJ9BC3BmusftqNRsi7HKZXDDp_EpdxHvEG_RyEdHVx5j5Zordhe_dG8wtRP6PDzvTdtWudjbbWo_Asx1M_4SgWv6az-68txWxTAewCgxC6mU9jCafNbdFnN-FezSLXj3spNS_t0A==)\n- [dev.to](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFjD0NStBi68VzH_nyheKRXhGXtXPNNSgiHYbD_WabtluKa4DHgTBs6UbzuGfIlG0dCEBCwAUue4WWbuctrhL2klJbAXtH1edj76_nDIMtpoBHZ1ZFYo-At3AxffYtTM8h0hFjJCiN5G3SIMMQvfHDoWxNZHdy5l4LMVtB_5T8O3ND8v_8STuJKqvagy85zWRsemAcl_6gn1Zlp8O_9Cq437A==)\n- [medium.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGVLvDlKDPcppZ06hp8c4mkeWyyphvZ1FeOeIW3rbNcVkeQFodgrPwQCnDUGZhSWDoIK-YXQk4bOd1719lNP-TTiQ6Oa-ls5b4AcsZ1ewO-qnYg9Dnt2NY2Lets3E2GfZJW8-WShMy3YAQLz1M6JgflaOy64fY9c8psTjkMruxjAI3XcB8seh8KJfwrCRvuvy-d5QDC)\n- [arize.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHNgvSJka18b2WKmvRU9-dhjM5jXR-yfApmmZh3peaBV1F2vsnA0aF2VQpt6HhXiDuD4PAVLzOev-jMLt9asAF1cNy5qJbYDJwGMTElgNlQ5PJIOG-ZQIfHu6GdEg==)\n- [gloo.digital](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEN0kWjzzS5Ra3AxULtIvX3ZwVtoo7VRWF9Vi_xOJd8II75n-r15yx-O2jPqDMg0fhA0TkLHmETiPHQUC0L4JJ5X_2Cse-XkUwrNrHTPVnInEDtFke8ZfFmI6vcrXU_J3rVRWMhkTAiljEVxvYERATLrLTxzI9YHD4zPoJjz3DuOhbkhbHw4mtFPLxGq9c2PUOW9J3U_hkI4r_eT8o-i5XHcJci)\n- [cam.ac.uk](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEaOLSB1-DnEaisyZFgKK_xafVATqnh28Qf8B-Y0SqlVyCSMCMabHGisfWCB-Y_iiUBqPkBX0_ivlLKJiZe-z7BRtdNLTBm7KMjSeuRuLjfkcRYVtTsK14w6gkkI2uk-5viHoifisQaOUMBenFzGmUwivf5g0sUSb5v)\n- [arxiv.org](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFXd9CDBpuHzYxeIaw75vlciY3JDu7DrrOeCcmFyvEDnMfN1fySkzj-XTH5X0Cz2T_uHbAkYPxzeAX_DUrptfqR0eQNrNaIGqUp1V-cEZb7LE0SZhAx4v_k7fHB)\n- [anthropic.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFfOCcRx2OuNTabBifC-9n8vVGJpn_p87oUIEzYkj7fbTEx-sZHQK9pgQAHryAsIGEjL_pdAMYyAcCZWECOogUWxoXFvVAKznKdLeR6XnzbEC0FBaEECYMXJL5Wajec6F5-K1ivroLZLNx4vvkNEOvYczxl)\n- [medium.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEe5KvHXf6YZoDNLkARGaf8Rz8wvScAqBKmjLygN9A0OhjLa2a9I2Rjnb-OsKR_Qbj-oRAEcS0lcNjjhNubBawZsiVH-_UGXXdUMo6-afegApRw3m28BIOG5pTSMFds4v63ScMeENWvRIzALEaOzIeGdBsEtuY9yMAlvqHui6neVsNMeZoK3nhQxdO4ZAkpvQG_NfIV6ipOmW4BMK3yuwqLZSU5TfnVa6LCmX6WlDq2WL2ydXO0)\n\n\n\n\n## Summary\nOpenAI Evals is an open-source framework designed by OpenAI for systematically evaluating large language models (LLMs) and systems built using them.

It aims to make the evaluation process more standardized and accessible across various machine learning domains.\n\nKey aspects of Hugging Face Evaluate include:\n\n*   **Components**: The library is structured around three main types of evaluation modules:\n    *   **Metrics**: These quantify a model\'s performance on a given dataset, often by comparing its predictions to ground truth labels. Examples include accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE, covering tasks in NLP, computer vision, and more.\n    *   **Comparisons**: These tools are used to assess the differences between two or more models, typically by comparing their predictions on test datasets.\n    *   **Measurements**: These provide insights into the properties and characteristics of datasets themselves or model predictions.\n\n*   **Ease of Use**: Users can load any evaluation module (metric, comparison, or measurement) with a single function call, `evaluate.load("module_name")`, and then use the `compute()` method to get results. The library supports iterative and distributed computation as well.\n\n*   **Broad Coverage**: Hugging Face Evaluate offers dozens of pre-implemented metrics for a wide range of modalities and tasks, including text, computer vision, and audio.\n\n*   **Extensibility and Community**: The Hugging Face Hub serves as a central place for these evaluation modules, and users can contribute their own custom metrics, comparisons, and measurements. Each module often includes a "Metric card" detailing its usage, limitations, and examples.\n\n*   **Advanced Evaluation Tools**:\n    *   **Evaluator**: This class simplifies the evaluation process by automating inference and only requiring a model, dataset, and metric. It integrates with Hugging Face Transformers pipelines but also supports custom pipelines.\n    *   **EvaluationSuite**: This allows for running a collection of evaluation tasks, often targeting specific benchmarks, providing a comprehensive assessment of models.\n\n*   **LLM Evaluation**: While Hugging Face Evaluate is versatile, for more recent evaluation approaches, especially for Large Language Models (LLMs), Hugging Face recommends its newer and more actively maintained library, LightEval. However, Hugging Face Evaluate still offers a user-friendly way to assess LLMs and datasets with standard metrics and tools.\n## References:\n- [wandb.ai](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGFku_QUK-PhP_16ploh8Kt265BpkvQn-BzBnRyibpXbrUaTsXW1dMbCAIWYgks8CM0P0O2NaH_VKRIlMALkU7jXwCksUiRdRcl_E52XIK4FPPUz3l3D9D57FK_wwGtby-LEQON3gzQCFeb13KK2vlN3ILcyke6JFFT8vOgYoFgsSA220xZTds2uYivT4Klp0GjaduUb-E=)\n- [github.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFvfTYCsiwG5sbzC41u9FTTYw6v69s5BoTouTcfCuRa5sK_ALPNVncA-iGo6DaDQ8FSQDawLaCx6BvZx4W2UZ5N16Z73sMyhkXYs3mCQwmaSjwktXXHNpRUJM2sxewDygSK)\n- [huggingface.co](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHeHW1-AWfOvqywu5oH4b6bhWu3kAVEsilJDdVzGnJbg9vrvVn4-OVBOmg3mOJeXZ9eE_c28r1g7vF-mcud7VeCppn-U_CAAcuH4_ZjX0WfkGsIgHa03EIQwhiI_Z2qN-yjfgbe)\n- [analyticsvidhya.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG-UXRdi4wJeM0iq9GfhVXjv6PCMQqN-pvsY2C_IG0Ahua9pAcJjpKc3rBO5tmWGP2BHfesSg1h3o3kiVA2wh2uEx9m3CXdts6Cj7SfZ5pyfXY-krg3r7LfdXiV3-p-RTWudZyP9xBtmi3aRaajDHTmokLlSS3AJN5Z2hjitA==)\n- [huggingface.co](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFOLBa16y3YQS3tUcy-gWLpFCNA0RbWMPgJptgz4FFBseCbf3ypAAf-qH9kj-0LrSzyyKd_LTEyPgKw1OSgv_qkGNMVcATjh9zd54OVR1FHAdvAPeSnHodZbaDBghtcHvTUQmluqjbWMDFu3FY2nQ==)\n- [vennify.ai](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQElnhcxn-9G7XDGIybvc4DUP01nP-VA6C1duZNQO2AxsG2HbbUYdUdNBDvAJkWFurhy0dtYU5JNLgbu1YLL9hkm7-tXHug4jr7nBEeODJ3Hlm6tpX4PZ21ScvWcI8IvQ5koh8KdsgUDoWKfh0G8-2U=)\n- [huggingface.co](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHEZj41qo3pV-uoo4svbsVH7O1k1Y6xubjw7NM0vR-tRYEJj7xYM3QiXm5lvoJcKbNKoN4oEJvmFgq0gW29FNcGHP2rzWJ2kNoMGn-MVAUtnuWBGPYau2s-pUiS9M8_mn9bqwCzsg==)\n- [youtube.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEJ3bkYC5RlfaG4-Wz61wflVGlQToUc1XPgmsPe8xjeZlxGk4pn5uVweoi5udIX6baclUg7tLvx4fYXbiFnzktaiyTYPySqfLgedyKwVzBRvjjpnuekWzezMxqzeqnM8QGc-v61Dw==)\n- [huggingface.co](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFJtKNe5-2gVZ1Kh0cxZqdB1KIb6rSalXLJHCvhz-0NVp8qAFYeE2d6crcdu-Z4rR-oCz2Yjfo2l6WTeaU1PpHvWZKnwZKOqFU2D_i6qALKY4aZQ8Z7dVbHi0ooLwrrRSBydlDz0a-VQgFmKw==)\n- [huggingface.co](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHQPPg6RtWvplRElqedtYBZD0Cta6OvomMdTo0Txq9V79y3v9Pgi_Ai9vgbIPly47zdYKo5eD6cDZEAePe1ZHulTPLkbSlt4XVmJdqx9-6DUAls0oZEE-iZLXP0bGT6pKgpLqiXvTOtG_3Um832)\n- [huggingface.co](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG7Ez9GeVC1ON46bBcNfbrx4Cu7LNp4oCineyMOpNZGttdRHF0ScjJxPL6rc9VfLjW7qvf_zCzgoQst3qlJ0o7SMeDXdqMfk3_IMzDIw9acYAnif3mKRd9kcpNhey_3qlB9nTSxP2hkcAj1TrO8b9u2)\n\n\n\n\n## Summary\nDeepEval is an open-source framework designed for the comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications.

It offers a systematic, data-driven approach to move beyond subjective "vibe checks" and into efficient evaluation workflows for AI applications.\n\nThe primary purpose of RAGAs is to address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics (like BLEU and ROUGE) which often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of RAG applications, such as factual accuracy and context relevance. Manual evaluation is also time-consuming, expensive, and not scalable. RAGAs tackles these challenges by combining LLM-driven metrics with systematic experimentation to create a continuous improvement loop.\n\nKey features of RAGAs include:\n*   **Objective Metrics:** It uses both LLM-based and traditional metrics to precisely evaluate LLM applications.\n*   **Test Data Generation:** RAGAs can automatically create comprehensive test datasets for various scenarios.\n*   **Seamless Integrations:** It works effectively with popular LLM frameworks like LangChain and major observability tools.\n*   **Feedback Loops:** The framework helps build feedback loops by leveraging production data to continuously enhance LLM applications.\n\nRAGAs is particularly beneficial for evaluating RAG systems, which combine the generative power of LLMs with the retrieval of relevant external documents to produce more informed and accurate responses. It assesses the performance of a RAG system\'s components—the retriever and the generator—both individually and as a unified pipeline.\n\nThe evaluation process with RAGAs is reference-free, meaning it doesn\'t require human-annotated "ground truth" answers. Instead, it prompts LLMs to analyze outputs and retrieved passages to generate proxy scores that correlate with human judgment.\n\nRAGAs decomposes RAG system evaluation into several principal dimensions, using a suite of metrics that include:\n*   **Faithfulness:** Measures the factual accuracy of the generated response based on the retrieved documents and checks if the answer is fully supported by the provided context.\n*   **Answer Relevance:** Determines how relevant the generated response is to the user\'s query.\n*   **Context Precision:** Focuses on the percentage of retrieved context that is relevant to the question.\n*   **Context Recall:** Assesses the percentage of necessary information from the ground truth that is captured by the retrieved context.\n\nThese individual metrics are then combined to calculate an overall RAGAs score, which quantifies the RAG system\'s performance comprehensively. This involves selecting relevant metrics, normalizing them (typically to a range of 0-1), and computing a weighted average, with weights assigned based on the priorities of each use case.\n\nThe typical workflow for evaluating an LLM application with RAGAs involves loading a dataset with test cases, querying the RAG system to get responses, evaluating these responses against ground truth (if available, or using LLM-based evaluations), displaying the results, and saving them for analysis.\n## References:\n- [github.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF922bEHIVN8Wed0Vwp1fOLqerCpSOrqzZ8q4NCfYotXgpUmQCT_ogKcnneDa9qNL06O3Wszec4Dr2FVEY0qw21FLvL64AB1dkRtdJOBkytfw7gEHU1dFy3ldY34AOgPMW7tmqirXI=)\n- [ragas.io](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG8F0sVdHu-QdwWIgWdtBRyG0qzaLwrxgxz65yurMSzlC46zVLEhRa7H1LXWPEl8BqrixGkl0jnpqgP1znltLdsd6U0lkeCKWrrUt1emQxJxWWVFaZJ5K11_Gm-)\n- [emergentmind.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEs4J6SoY8MV3E8Bcs11l1XUXRXvUKkVfqLVc2JhX9Uaj37EyEHRL84m6NPh3Pkcf0mvAHD0M_WEEsA_Y_Jqz3ityA6O77DmAFtw2yK1M1Sj_CVERscG96lceUhTQVNCA3mZwHbDn-h3rs=)\n- [medium.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGkpdG4ijahvK4D41dZnaYubzukRZgd4SoPG_TNl9K-Jq-SAMPSsKP1-jUZEe-FGhMkWQVQhs-LK9LJqVaB2ZOmF4sHDtTew0w-pjAX1Xjp1s61MnNj92L-nMjAKNcxUfzPYr0dLImLF5v8XajlEc-LESWjLljPuh1bukdJpzxJMiHBhvIdnY6CUggVWZLTnb5yYFlE2KSuN4HhKwsfWCWJ_u7JbOm2qA==)\n- [youtube.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHy2_gXyixsh7vSzYlcgjScIZs6Z6LkffHXoxi2RuVYGRvSdXyfk8rhdzPWA4iX5qtokG3trmMXcax0_29AbezaBdgb57fBVOqUqHXdE08UYEfHb6t6GFA8AamHDNUEkR2o1x6BOME=)\n- [youtube.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEzLNpcel8QpWSOPGoMrDRfelCWm9Z7UQPNgaBTDovLTvUKtB3HS5kSY1vZMgSNF0LCl6PmKjOA32Nqdsyy9-FtlHiAIxWh8yTNwG3Z_847kGA6x34BNjH6QmojXH8_sPSweDqmtv8=)\n- [machinelearningmastery.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFbkSdbDhdlL9gk-3WZo71IdxcFC3kSzdyXTjR8UdIUwwgUrCNTmCQsDH5bi0NKtYewaT1SD8JtqPq4uGSm1Ei_IKa_IQpr5DjyxMWcbJy_fLMzS6qtu6Wg_kD8vNh-XEz-O2-SuOmKpfA3Nn3bLiVy6p1KP3i6nhHqWLynoD9MA3UxE_JY7qFbSwQ7fXRLMCBkH7I=)\n- [medium.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHuwWNe5OE5D2QfEKMBLHE4YuGktPkf-ga-BRia9KNsVL-sOpvNEm_ZR-Q-s-lCtRrLz1cASptf6hOr4_d2JYuUbm6kbyW99MX4zDXEqfZU_PwiNsbdT5hgMlYRwPQwzZfGDhDlx23jBM_HVUJ4GhSXXYvo2Gm7rqd3JF_ZmBr23BvovFJzR89PBooJBtHw)\n- [ragas.io](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHZ-uQa8hM05S321g5rz2Eog74blTn9cg25cvzvP6skLaITVPOXFXtieYEMLPg10MkDaai3yCTrFJ3D-3m6B6iYlHCQ4lSpGV2HiRdc5kgE0EYla905vQ3I_zfMGfrwKoJyABgzhdwumOJWGjk=)\n ',
