The content is divided into four main sections:\r\n\r\n1.  **Narrative Section:** Contains a Level 1 Heading titled 'The Evals Engineer's Dilemma' followed by a Text component displaying the full narrative story.\r\n2.  **Media Section:** Separated by a Divider, this section starts with a Level 2 Heading titled 'Associated Media Assets'. It contains a horizontal Row component, distributed evenly, displaying six media components: three Image components, two AudioPlayer components, and one Video component, using the paths provided in the data model.\r\n3.  **AI Evaluation Frameworks Section:** Separated by a Divider, this section starts with a Level 2 Heading titled 'AI Evaluation Frameworks Overview'. It contains a Column layout where the general summary is placed in a Card (with a Level 3 Heading 'What are AI Evals?'). Below this card, a horizontal Row displays four additional Card components, one for each specific framework (OpenAI Evals, Hugging Face Evaluate, DeepEval, RAGAs).
