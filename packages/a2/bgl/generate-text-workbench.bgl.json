Fantastic food n ambience. The bar has a great feel. Bar tenders very professional and love the manager Jenna                 Tara L.               Came with my good buddies for lunch and drinks. Their menu is super simple. Not many items to choose from which I appreciate. Big menus are harder to choose from IMO! The French dip was so good! The meat was tender and flavorful along with the au jus. We also enjoyed their cornbread bites which had a kick of jalapeno. The Hemingway daiquiri was also good - nice and smooth.                 Natalie C.               An upscale restaurant in the middle of a quiet downtown Los Altos. We've been here a few times for special occasions and it's a solid choice for a darker, quieter, atmosphere - meant for the older or couples without children group. This is not a place you should expect to bring larger, louder, parties or children so plan accordingly for an adult lunch or dinner date - it's unrealistic to expect anything else. Food is on the pricier side but not the most expensive meal I've seen around the Bay Area. Service was quick and attentive - they came by countless times to refill out party of 4's waters and drinks promptly. All the dishes we ordered (Cedar Plank Salmon, Ribs, Rotisserie Chicken, and the artichoke) were tasty and well cooked.                 Ilona M.               Stopped by here with a few friends for dessert and everything was impeccable! The oreo cookie dessert was to die for. Will definitely be back! Taking one star off because we asked for espresso martinis, and our server said that even though they have a full bar, they couldn't serve us the drink but they could bring us an espresso shot and the vodka separately? This was a little confusing. But otherwise, everything was great.                 Camy T.               I've been eating at the Los Altos Grill with my family since I was a kid, but had never been for lunch! We went right when it opened, there was no line but shorty after they were packed- I recommend going right at 12 before the rush! We ordered family style- got champagne for the table, ahi tuna appetizer, corn bread bites, and the chicken sandwich + French dip split three ways for sharing. Overall a delicious meal and all the food came out pretty quickly. The music was fantastic as usual! The candle at the table and lighting always sets the tone for a more intimate meal.                 Brian H.               Ok . I do t know why it's not rated higher ... the inside is really nicely done. It has a homey feel. The wood ceiling is really nice and is the layout . It has an open feeling , yet is a little small at the same time. . Parking is abundant . The entrance is in their parking lot. We went around thinking it was on the street, it is, just not the street we were on. lol. We ate at the bar- you are seated by the hostess. It's not open seating at the bar - at least not last night. Thursday night is when we went. The food was excellent. EXCELLENT. We had the trout and the cedar plank salmon. Oh my. Fantastic. The out had a light crust and the coleslaw was to die for. I like coleslaw. I've never had it like this. It's defiantly a winner . The Cedar plant Salmon was very think And flavorful. The Broccoli was just right and my mashed potatoes were very creamy. I don't drink - the bar is fully stocked and a lot of people around us looked very well taken care of. The bartender was attentive - she was very busy and the bar staff helped out. I will be back. And I highly recommend eating lunch here as well. The menu has something for everyone.
