                "# Gemini developer Search Engine Marketing (SEM) overview\n\n## Developer marketing objectives\n\n1. Drive reach and awareness for ‘Build with Gemini’\n2. Drive Gemini trial through AI Studio\n3. Onboard and engage developers to Google AI Studio (showing a clear path to Vertex AI)\n\n## Effective SEM best practices\n\n- Headlines have a 30 character limit, Descriptions have a 90 character limit\n- You can have up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions per ad, with a campaign limit of 3 responsive search ads\n- Headlines should include at least a few variations that contain your brand name and a few variations that include a call to action\n- Calls to action should reflect intended user outcomes like clicking \"Get API Key\" buttons on site for example\n- Likewise, Descriptions should include both a call to action, your brand name and details about value propositions, how your product is solving pain points, or how our product is differentiating itself from competitors\n- Ads should align with the landing page copy as much as possible, this will improve ad rank and delivery, in this case please reference: https://ai.google.dev\n- Ads should also include references to target keywords that trigger our ad delivery. Here is a list of keywords that are currently live.\n- Never use the word \"free\" in the headlines or descriptions. Avoid mentions of \"free trials\" or \"trying it for free\", or variation on that theme.\n\n## Target audience\n\n- Developers in the explore and learn mindset:\n\n  - \"I like to stay ahead of developer news and I’m curious about Google’s AI tools\"\n  - \"I’m in my first steps of my AI development journey\"\n  - \"I’ve heard about this new model, Gemini, from Google...\"\n\n- Developers already using competitor model solutions (ex. OpenAI API, Microsoft Copilot)\n- Developers who are looking for models for specific use cases\n\n  - \"Search embeddings\" or \"RAG\"/\"retrieval augmented generation\" or \"text generation models\"\n\n- Practitioners leveraging coding assistants and AI-enabled tools to accelerate workflows, some integrating AI via APIs\n- Product and strategy owners assessing the value of AI in their business, and leveraging genAI to enhance productivity and creativity\n\n## We want developers to\n\n- Think: \"Google is a leader in the AI game. Gemini looks exciting. I want to try it.\"\n- Feel: \"Excited that I will be able to build with Google's most advanced model.\"\n- Do: Visit AI Studio, get an API key, and prompt Gemini Pro.\n\n## Ad copy test dimensions\n\n- Product focused\n  - Awareness/education of product (\"do I know what this product is and what is does?\")\n  - Value of product\n  - Consideration of product (\"is this product one I would use?\")\n  - Intent to use (\"this is a product I see myself using\")\n- Ad focused:\n  - This ad is helpful/engaging\n  - This ad builds trust in the brand\n- Search strategy:\n  - Help developers navigate multiple generative AI offerings from Google.\n  - Target upper funnel keywords that indicate a user is curious about AI and app development (ex: \"generative AI,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" and \"uses of AI\") as well as branded terms like \"Gemini AI model\" and drive to the \"Build with Gemini\" landing page where they can learn more.\n\n## Results of first iteration\n\nThese are the results of the first iteration of writing the ads, formatted as (headline) (headline character length) (description) (description character length):\n\n### Set 1\n\nHeadline Headline Limit 30 Description Description Limit 90\nUnlock AI Power 15 Transform workflow with Google AI.

I also only see 1 description that actively mentions \"development\" and a few others that call out \"apps\"\nInstead: It would be great to get more variation on Developer focused messaging, especially around different day to day tasks that Gemini can help with\n\nCritique: I don't see any CTA (call to action) call outs in the headlines (i.e \"Get Started\" or \"Get the API Key Today\")\nInstead: it would be great for headlines to segment out chunks of headlines by type. We usually have 3 types of headlines we use: Brand name, Value Prop/Feature, Call to Action. This may help generate more results-driven headlines.\n\nCritique: \"Unlock\", \"Empower\" and \"Discover\" -type language is not really present on the Gemini site. While we like the tone and impact of \"Unlock\", this misalignment can result in unwanted Consumer clicks, or ad ranking declines due to Google not finding similar language in our site content\nInstead: If we can incorporate more action-based terms from the site, I think we'll speak more effectively to our target audiences. I see terms on-site like \"Integrate\", \"Build\", \"Versatility\", \"Experience\" as some potential swaps here\n\n### Set 2\n\nHeadline Headline Limit 30 Description Description Limit 90\nTry Google's Advanced AI Model 30 Experience Google's most capable AI model.

Leverages device processing power at no cost.\n\n### Integrate Gemini into your app with the API\n\nIt’s fast and free to start building with Gemini 1.0 Pro in Google AI Studio\n\n```python\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=\"gemini-pro-vision\")\nresponse = model.generate_content([\"What's in this photo?\", img])\n```\n\n### Build on Vertex AI:\n\n- Fully managed AI platform\n- Leverage Google Cloud's security, safety, privacy, data governance and compliance to customize Gemini with complete data control.\n- Built for scale\n- Tune and augment Gemini with your data, then manage and deploy in your AI-powered apps, search experiences, and conversational agents.\n\n### Gemini Nano\n\nAndroid AICore enables our most powerful phones to run Gemini 1.0 Nano, making it easy for you to build AI experiences that work offline or use sensitive info better kept on-device.\n\nAvailable on Pixel 8 Pro and samsung s24 series, with more coming soon\n\n### Gemma: Next-Gen Open Models for AI innovation\n\nLightweight, customizable, and accessible models empower the ML community with unprecedented flexibility and collaboration.\n"
