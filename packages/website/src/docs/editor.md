The Editor API provides a way to edit a graph. It is designed to work in conjunction with the [Inspector API](../inspector) and helps ensure that the graph edits retain their structural integrity.

> [!NOTE]
> The full list of types of Editor API can be found in [/packages/breadboard/src/editor/types.ts](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/blob/main/packages/breadboard/src/editor/types.ts)

## Creating an editor

Calling the `edit` method creates an instance of an `EditableGraph`. This method expects a `GraphDescriptor` as its first argument:

```ts
import { edit } from "google-labs/breadboard";

// Returns an instance of `EditableGraph`.
const graph = edit(bgl);
```

The editor contains a few methods that are paired together: there's one method that performs an edit and the second method that tells us whether we can perform this edit. Both methods return the same value: an `EditResult` promise.

The first method usually has a name like `doStuff` and the second one looks like `canDoStuff`.

This pairing enables checking whether an edit would be valid without actually making an edit. The method that performs an edit calls the method to check whether an edit is valid first, so it is not necessary to call them in succession.

For example we can add nodes to the graph using the `addNode` method:

```ts
// Returns `Promise<EditResult>`.
const result = await graph.addNode({ id "foo", type: "bar" });
if (!result.success) {
  console.warn("Adding node failed with this error", result.error);
}
```

And we can use its sidekick `canAddNode` to simply check if adding this node is possible:

```ts
// Returns `Promise<EditResult>`.
const result = await graph.canAddNode({ id: "foo", type: "bar" });
if (result.success) {
  console.log("Yay, we can add this node, proceed forth");
} else {
  console.warn("Can't add this node", result.error);
}
```

## Kits

To ensure that `canDoStuff` methods tell us useful things, we need to supply the editor a list of kits. Kits are collections of functions that are invoked during running the graph. We can provide kits as `kits` property on the second, optional `EditableGraphOptions` argument of the `edit` method:

```ts
import Core from "@google-labs/core-kit";
import JSONKit from "@google-labs/json-kit";

const graph = edit(bgl, { kits: [asRuntime(Core), asRunTime(JSONKit)] });
```

## Editing a graph

There are five edit operations that we can perform on the graph:

- `addNode` -- adds a new node to the graph (or check if we can do so with `canAddNode`)

- `removeNode` -- remove a node from the graph (with `canRemoveNode` companion)

- `addEdge` -- add an edge to the graph (`canAddEdge` to check if that's possible)

- `removeEdge` -- remove an edge from the graph (`canRemoveEdge` to check only)

- `changeConfiguration` -- change configuration of a node (`canChangeConfiguration` to check only).

- `changeMetadata` -- change metadata (title and description) of a node (`canChangeMetadata` to check only).

### Editing `star` edges and alternatives

Connecting a `star` port and a named port results in an invalid graph topology and is disallowed by the Editor API. So, when we try to do something like this:

```ts
const edgeSpec = { from: "node-1", out: "text", to: "node-2", in: "*" };
const result = await graph.canAddEdge(edgeSpec);
```

We will get a result signifying a failure:

```ts
// Reports `false`
console.log(result.success);
```

However, the Editor API will helpfully tweak the edge a little bit and provide an `alternative` property in the result:

```ts
// Reports `{ from: "node-1", out: "text", to: "node-2", in: "text" }`.
// Note that it replaced the `*` with `text`.
console.log(result.alternative);
```

This alternative will be guaranteed to be a valid edge and will be a direct conversion to an edge between two named ports: the Editor API will use the non-`star` end of the edge as the port name for the `star` end. For instance, in example above, it replaced
the `*` input port with the `text` input port.

When such alternative can't be created (like when an edge like this already exist, or the node doesn't allow a port by this name), the result will have no `alternative` property.

By default, the `addEdge` method will use this alternative to add an edge, assuming that the user wanted to make a connection between to named ports:

```ts
const edgeSpec = { from: "node-1", out: "text", to: "node-2", in: "*" };
// Will add alternative edge:
// { from: "node-1", out: "text", to: "node-2", in: "text" }
const result = await graph.addEdge(edgeSpec);
```

In cases when we don't want the Editor API to make this assumption, we need to supply the optional boolean argument in the `addEdge` method. When `true` the `addEdge` will be more strict about making assumptions and as a result, will fail to add such an edge:

```ts
const edgeSpec = { from: "node-1", out: "text", to: "node-2", in: "*" };
// Will not add an alternative edge.
const result = await graph.addEdge(edgeSpec, false);
```

The same optional argument also works for the `changeEdge` method.

## Starting a new graph

If we want to start a brand-new graph, we can use the handy `blank` method, provided by the Editor API:

```ts
import { blank } from "google-labs/breadboard";

// Returns a new `GraphDescriptor` instance
// of a pre-built blank graph.
const myNewGraph = blank();
```

The newly-created graph will have a pre-filled title and description, a version of `0.0.1` and two connected nodes: the `input` node connected to the `output` node with one wire. The wire will go from `text` port to `text` port of the respective nodes.

## Graph versioning

To help us keep track of the edits, the `EditableGraph` has a `version()` method, which returns the current version of the graph:

```ts
// Returns a number.
const current = graph.version();
```

By default, a new `EditableGraph` instance starts with version `0` and increments it for each change.

To supply a different starting version, use the `version` option when creating a new `EditableGraph` instance:

```ts
import Core from "@google-labs/core-kit";
import JSONKit from "@google-labs/json-kit";

// Let's start with version 1000.
const version = 1000;
const graph = edit(bgl, {
  kits: [asRuntime(Core), asRunTime(JSONKit)],
  version,
});
```

## Editing subgraphs

Since every graph may have **embedded subgraphs** in it, we can use the Editor API to access and edit these subgraphs as well. Every subgraph has an identifier that is unique among all subgraphs within their graph. The API uses this id to add, remove, replace subgraphs and manages the `EditableGraph` instances for subgraphs.

```ts
// Returns an `EditableGraph` instance or `null` if not found.
const subgraph = graph.getGraph("foo");
if (subgraph) {
  // Edit the subgraph
  // ...
}

// Attempts to add a new subgraph and returns `EditResult`.
// Returns null if a subgraph with this id already exists,
// and an `EditableGraph` instance otherwise.
const newSubgraph = graph.addGraph("bar", blank());
if (!newSubgraph) {
  console.log("A graph with id 'bar' already exists.");
}

// Attempts to remove the subgraph and returns `EditResult`.
// Will fail if a subgraph with this id does not exist.
const result = graph.removeGraph("bar");
if (result.success) {
  console.log("Yay, removed subgraph 'bar'.");
} else {
  console.log("The subgraph 'bar' does not exist".)
}

// Attempts to replace a subgraph and returns `EditResult`.
// Returns null if a subgraph with this id does not exist,
// and an `EditableGraph` instance of the new subgraph otherwise.
const replaced = graph.replaceGraph("foo", blank());
if (!replaced) {
  console.log("A graph with id 'foo' does not exist.")
}
```

To find out if a particular `EditableGraph` instance is an embedded subgraph, use the `parent()` method:

```ts
// If subgraph, returns `EditableGraph` instance of the parent graph.
const parentGraph = subgraph.parent();
if (parentGraph) {
  console.log("A subgraph!");
} else {
  console.log("Not a subgraph");
}
```

Because they are part of a larger graph, subgraphs do not have their own versions and attempting to call the `version()` method on a subgraph will throw an error.

Subgraphs may not contain other subgraphs, so in the same fashion as `version()`, the `getGraph`, `addGraph`, `replaceGraph`, and `removeGraph` will throw
when called on a subgraph.

## Accessing the graph

To access the underlying `GraphDescriptor` instance, use the `raw()` method on the `EditableGraph` instance.

```ts
const graph = edit(bgl, { kits });
await graph.addNode({ id: "foo", type: "bar" });
// Returns the `GraphDescriptor` instance.
const newBgl = graph.raw();
```

The `raw()` method will correctly serialize all of graph's subgraph and reflect their edits.

## Inspecting the graph

Because the graph constantly changes, it can be tedious to keep track of the latest changes and keep creating new instances of `InspectableGraph`. To help with that, there's an `inspect` method on the `EditableGraph`:

```ts
// Guaranteed to be inspecting the latest graph.
// Returns `InspectableGraph`.
const inspectableGraph = graph.inspect();
```

In term of lifecycle, the `InspectableGraph` changes more frequently than the `EditableGraph`. So, hang on to the `EditableGraph` instance and use it to create `InspectableGraph` instances. It will cache them for you, only creating a new inspector when the graph changes.

## Listening to changes

The `EditableGraph` instance also the `addEventListener` method, which works pretty much like any [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) -- we can subscribe to listen to events that are dispatched by this instance. Currently the following events are supported:

- `graphchange` -- dispatched on every change of a graph or any of the subgraphs. The event object provides two useful properties: `graph` and `version`. The `graph` property contains the updated `GraphDescriptor` instance and the `version` has the version of this instance.

- `graphchangereject` -- dispatched when a proposed change is rejected. This may happen because the change is redundant or because the graph integrity would be jeopardized by the change. The event provides access to these properties: `graph`, which is the `GraphDescriptor` instance on which the change was attempted, and `reason`. The `reason` property itself has a `type` property, which can be either `"nochange"` or `"error`". The `"nochange"` indicates that the change was redundant, and `"error"` signals that the proposed changed would have resulted in an invalid graph. In the latter case, the `reason.error` property will contain the same error that would have been returned by the various `can*` methods from above.
