The Editor API provides a way to edit a graph. It is designed to work in conjuction with the [Inspector API](../inspector) and helps ensure that the graph edits retain their structural integrity.

> [!NOTE]

## Creating an editor

Calling the `edit` method creates an instance of an `EditableGraph`. This method expects a `GraphDescriptor` as its first argument:

```ts
import { edit } from "google-labs/breadboard";

// Returns an instance of `EditableGraph`.
const graph = edit(bgl);
```

The editor contains a few methods that are paired together: there's one method that performs an edit and the second method that tells us whether we can perform this edit. Both methods return the same value: an `EditResult` promise.

The first method usually has a name like `doStuff` and the second one looks like `canDoStuff`.

This pairing enables checking whether an edit would be valid without actually making an edit. The method that performs an edit calls the method to check whether an edit is valid first, so it is not necessary to call them in succession.

For example we can add nodes to the graph using the `addNode` method:

```ts
// Returns `Promise<EditResult>`.
const result = await graph.addNode({ id "foo", type: "bar" });
if (!result.success) {
  console.warn("Adding node failed with this error", result.error);
}
```

And we can use its sidekick `canAddNode` to simply check if adding this node is possible:

```ts
// Returns `Promise<EditResult>`.
const result = await graph.canAddNode({ id: "foo", type: "bar" });
if (result.success) {
  console.log("Yay, we can add this node, proceed forth");
} else {
  console.warn("Can't add this node", result.error);
}
```

## Kits

To ensure that `canDoStuff` methods tell us useful things, we need to supply the editor a list of kits. Kits are collections of functions that are invoked during running the graph. We can provide kits as `kits` property on the second, optional `EditableGraphOptions` argument of the `edit` method:

```ts
import Core from "@google-labs/core-kit";
import JSONKit from "@google-labs/json-kit";

const graph = edit(bgl, { kits: [asRuntime(Core), asRunTime(JSONKit)] });
```

## Editing a graph

There are five edit operations that we can perform on the graph:

- `addNode` -- adds a new node to the graph (or check if we can do so with `canAddNode`)

- `removeNode` -- remove a node from the graph (with `canRemoveNode` companion)

- `addEdge` -- add an edge to the graph (`canAddEdge` to check if that's possible)

- `removeEdge` -- remove an edge from the graph (`canRemoveEdge` to check only)

- `changeConfiguration` -- change configuration of a node (`canChangeConfiguration` to check only).

- `changeMetadata` -- change metadata (title and description) of a node (`canChangeMetadata` to check only).

## Accesing the graph

To access the resulting graph, use the `raw()` method on the `EditableGraph` instance.

```ts
const graph = edit(bgl, { kits });
await graph.addNode({ id: "foo", type: "bar" });
const newBgl = graph.raw();
```

## Inspecting the graph

Because the graph constantly changes, it can be tedious to keep track of the latest changes and keep creating new instances of `InspectableGraph`. To help with that, there's an `inspect` method on the `EditableGraph`:

```ts
// Guaranteed to be inspecting the latest graph.
// Returns `InspectableGraph`.
const inspectableGraph = graph.inspect();
```

In term of lifecycle, the `InspectableGraph` changes more frequently than the `EditableGraph`. So, hang on to the `EditabelGraph` instance and use it to create `InspectableGraph` instances. It will cache them for you, only creating a new inspector when the graph changes.
