{% assign src_url = "https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/core-kit/src/nodes/" %}

This is the kit that provides the most fundamental building blocks for Breadboard and contains the following nodes:

## append

Use this node to accumulate local state, like context in a prompt.

The node looks for property called `accumulator` in its input. All other properties are appended to this property, and returned as `accumulator` output property.

The way the properties are appended depends on the type of the `accumulator` input property.

If the `accumulator` property is "string-ey" (that is, it's a `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `bigint`, `null` or `undefined`), the properties will be appended as strings, formatted as `{{property_name}}: {{proprety_value}}` and joined with "`\n`".

If the `accumulator` property is an array, the properties will be appended as array items, formatted as `{{property_name}}: {{proprety_value}}`,

Otherwise, the `accumulator` property will be treated as an object and the properties will be added as properties on this object.

### Example

If we send the `append` node an input of `Question` with the value of `How old is planet Earth?` and the `accumulator` value of `\n`:

```json
{
  "accumulator": "\n",
  "Question": "How old is planet Earth?"
}
```

We will see the following output:

```json
{
  "accumulator": "\n\nQuestion: How old is planet Earth?"
}
```

If we send the node an input of `Question` with the value of `How old is planet Earth?` and the `accumulator` value of `[]`:

```json
{
  "accumulator": [],
  "Question": "How old is planet Earth?"
}
```

We will get the output:

```json
{
  "accumulator": ["Question: How old is planet Earth?"]
}
```

If we send the node an input of `Question` with the value of `How old is planet Earth?` and the `accumulator` value of `{}`:

```json
{
  "accumulator": {},
  "Question": "How old is planet Earth?"
}
```

We'll get the output of:

```json
{
  "accumulator": {
    "Question": "How old is planet Earth?"
  }
}
```

### Implementation

- [append.ts]({{src_url}}append.ts)

## fetch

Use this node to fetch data from the Internet. Practically, this is a wrapper around [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

### Example

If we would like to fetch data from `https://example.com`, we would send the following inputs to `fetch`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

And receive this output:

```json
{
  "response": "<response from https://example.com>"
}
```

### Inputs

- `url` -- required, URL to fetch. For now, this node can only make a GET request.
- `headers` -- object (optional), a set of headers to be passed to the request.
- `raw` boolean (optional), specifies whether or not to return raw text (`true`) or parse the response as JSON (`false`). The default value is `false`.

### Outputs

- `response` -- the response from the server. If `raw` is `false`, the response will be parsed as JSON.

### Implementation

- [fetch.ts]({{src_url}}fetch.ts)

## runJavascript

Use this node to execute JavaScript code. The node recognizes a required `code` input property, which is a string that contains the code to be executed. It also recognizes a `name` input property, which is a string that specifies the name of the function that will be invoked to execute the code. If not supplied, the `run` function name will be used.

All other input properties will be passed as arguments to the function.

The code is executed in a new V8 context in Node or a Web Worker in the browser, which means that it cannot access any variables or functions from the outside.

The node will pass the result of the execution as the `result` output property.

### Example:

If we send the following inputs to `runJavascript`:

```json
{
  "code": "function run() { return 1 + 1; }"
}
```

We will get this output:

```json
{
  "result": 2
}
```

If we send:

```json
{
  "code": "function run({ what }) { return `hello ${what}`; }",
  "what": "world"
}
```

We will get:

```json
{
  "result": "hello world"
}
```

### Inputs

- `code` - required, must contain the code to execute
- `name` - optional, must contain the name of the function to invoke (default: `run`)
- zero or more inputs that will be passed as arguments to the function.

### Outputs

- `result` - the result of the execution

### Implementation

- [run-javascript.ts]({{src_url}}run-javascript.ts)

## secrets

Use this node to access secrets, such as API keys or other valuable bits of information that you might not want to store in the graph itself. The node takes in an array of strings named `keys`, matches the process environment values, and returns them as outputs. This enables connecting edges from environment variables.

### Example

Use this node to pass the `PALM_KEY` environment variable to the `text-completion` node. The input:

```json
{
  "keys": ["PALM_KEY"]
}
```

Will produce this output:

```json
{
  "PALM_KEY": "<value of the API key from the environment>"
}
```

### Inputs

- `keys` - required, must contain an array of strings that represent the keys to look up in the environment. If not supplied, empty output is returned.

### Outputs

- one output for each key that was found in the environment.

### Implementation

- [secrets.ts]({{src_url}}secrets.ts)

## passthrough

This is a no-op node. It takes the input property bag and passes it along as output, unmodified. This node can be useful when the board needs an entry point, but the rest of the board forms a cycle.

### Example

```js
board.input().wire("say->", board.passthrough().wire("say->", board.output()));

board.runOnce({
  say: "Hello, world!",
});

console.log("result", result);
```

Will produce this output:

```sh
result { say: 'Hello, world!' }
```

See [Chapter 9: Let's build a chatbot](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/breadboard/docs/tutorial#chapter-9-lets-build-a-chat-bot) of Breadboard tutorial to see another example of usage.

### Inputs

- any properties

### Outputs

- the properties that were passed as inputs

### Implementation

- [passthrough.ts]({{src_url}}passthrough.ts)

## invoke

Use this node to invoke another board from this board.

It recognizes `path`, `graph`, and `board` properties that specify, respectively, a file path or URL to the serialized board, directly the serialized-as-JSON board, and a `BoardCapability` (returned by `lambda` or `import`).

The rest of the inputs in the property bag are passed along to the invoked board as its inputs. If other inputs were bound to the board via wires into the `lambda` or `import` node, then those have precedence over inputs passed here.

The outputs of the invoked board will be passed along as outputs of the `invoke` node.

### Inputs

- `path`, which specifes the file path or URL to the serialized board to be included.
- `graph`, which is a serialized board
- `board`, a `BoardCapability` representing a board, created by `lambda` or `import`.
- any other properties are passed as inputs for the invoked board.

### Outputs

- the outputs of the invoked board

### Implementation

- [invoke.ts]({{src_url}}invoke.ts)

## import

Creates a lambda board from a pre-existing board, either loaded from `path` or passed as JSON via `graph`. All other inputs are bound to the board, which is returned as `board`.

### Inputs

- `path`, which specifes the file path or URL to the serialized board to be included.
- `graph`, which is a serialized board
- all other inputs are bound to the board

### Outputs

- `board`, a `BoardCapability`, which can be passed to `invoke` and other nodes that can invoke boards.

### Implementation

- [import.ts]({{src_url}}import.ts)

## reflect

This node is used to reflect the board itself. It has no required inputs and provides a JSON representation of the board as a `graph` output property. This node can be used for getting information that might be stored in the structure of the board.

### Example

```js
import { Board } from "@google-labs/breadboard";

const board = new Board();

board.input().wire("", board.reflect().wire("graph->", board.output()));

const result = await board.runOnce({});
console.log("result", result);
```

will print:

```sh
result {
  graph: {
    edges: [ [Object], [Object] ],
    nodes: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ],
    kits: []
  }
}
```

### Inputs

- ignored

### Outputs

- `graph` -- JSON representation of the board

### Implementation

- [reflect.ts]({{src_url}}reflect.ts)
