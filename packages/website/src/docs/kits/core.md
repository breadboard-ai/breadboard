This is the kit that provides the most fundamental building blocks for Breadboard. The component it provides tend to be fairly low-level. Think of these components as indivisible atoms of Breadboard universe, or as the plumbing that makes everything run. Many of the other components (all of the [Agent Kit](/breadboard/docs/kits/agents/) components, for example) are created by wiring using these together.

> [!TIP]
> Most of these components are closer to actual programming than just dragging and dropping high-level components. Expect climbing a learning curve to get comfortable using them.

## The `curry` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-curry.bgl.json" | board }}

Takes a board and bakes in (or [curries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying), using the computer science term) the supplied port inputs into it. Very useful when we want to invoke a board with the same input values many times (like with [`map`](#the-map-component)).

### Input ports

The `curry` component has a single input port plus any number of additional ports.

- **Board** (id: `$board`) -- the board to curry the values into. This port has the `board` behavior and will accept a URL of the board or the actual BGL of the board.

Values supplied with any additional ports will be curried into the output board.

### Output ports

The component has a single output port.

- **Board** (id: `board`) -- the resulting curried board.

### Example

Let's suppose that we have this board that creates a simple greeting given a name and location, using the [`promptTemplate`](/breadboard/docs/kits/templates/) component.

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/example-simple-greeting.bgl.json" | board }}

If we need to print out a set of greetings for a bunch of people visiting from the same location, we can use the `curry` component to bake the Location information into the board and then call it multiple times with a different name.

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-curry.bgl.json" | board }}

> [!TIP]
> The `curry` component is also useful for introspecting boards: you can use it to load a board via a URL and then examine the output as [BGL](/breadboard/docs/concepts/#breadboard-graph-language-bgl).

### Implementation

- [curry.ts]({{src_url}}curry.ts)

## The `deflate` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-deflate.bgl.json" | board }}

This component converts all [inline data to stored data](/breadboard/docs/reference/data-store/), saving memory. Useful when working with multimodal content.

### Input ports

The component has a single input port.

- **Data** (id: `data`) -- the data to scan and convert all instances of inline base64-encoded strings to lightweight handles. Data can be of any shape.

### Output ports

The component has a single output port.

- **Data** (id: `data`) -- the result of deflating the input data. Safely passes data through if it's already stored or no inline data is present.

### Example

In the board above, a chunk of JSON is fetched. This JSON contains a base64-encoded string of an image. The `deflate` component turns it into a lightweight handle and then passes it on to output.

### Implementation

- [deflate.ts]({{src_url}}deflate.ts)

## The `fetch` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-fetch.bgl.json" | board }}

Use this component to fetch data from the Internet. Implementation-wise, this is a wrapper around [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) with a few Breadboard-specific tweaks.

The tweaks are:

- When "Content-Type" is specified as "multipart/form-data", the value passed into the **Body** port is treated as a key/value object representing [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) properties and their values.

- Before sending the request, all [Data store lightweight handles](/breadboard/docs/reference/data-store/) are converted to base64 encoded strings or multipart encoded chunks, depending on the content type.

- After receiving the response, any [blob]() responses are converted to [Data Store lightweight handles](/breadboard/docs/reference/data-store/).

### Input ports

The component has the following input ports.

- **URL** (id: `url`) -- required, the URL to fetch.

- **Method** (id: `method`) -- string (optional), the request [method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods). Default is `GET`.

- **Headers** (id: `headers`) -- object (optional), a set of [request headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers). Default is empty.

- **Body** (id: `body`) -- object (optional), the [request body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#body). Default is empty.

- **Raw** (id: `raw`) -- boolean (optional), specifies whether or not to return raw text (`true`) or parse the response as JSON (`false`). The default value is `false`.

- **Stream** (id: `stream`) -- boolean (optional), specifies whether the response is expected to be a stream. The default value is `false`.

### Output ports

- **Content Type** (id: 'contentType') -- contains response content type.

- **Response** (id: `response`) -- the response from the server. If `raw` is `false` (which it is by default) and content type is `application/json`, the response will be parsed as JSON.

- **Response Headers** (id: `responseHeaders`) -- contains [response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers).

- **Status** (id: `status`) -- contains [response status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

- **Status Text** (id: `statusText`) -- contains response status text.

### Example

In the board above, the `fetch` component makes a call to Wikipedia [open search API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Opensearch) and then passes the response to the output.

### Implementation

- [fetch.ts]({{src_url}}fetch.ts)

## The `inflate` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-inflate.bgl.json" | board }}

Does opposite of what the [`deflate`](#the-deflate-component) component does. Scans provided data and converts all [lightweight handles to inline, base64 encoded strings](/breadboard/docs/reference/data-store/).

### Input ports

The component has a single input port.

- **Data** (id: `data`) -- the data to scan and convert all instances of lightweight handles to inline base64-encoded strings. Data can be of any shape.

### Output ports

The component has a single output port.

- **Data** (id: `data`) -- the result of inflating the input data. Safely passes data through if it's already inline or no stored data is present.

### Example

In the board above, any multimedia content supplied as input will be turned into base64-encoded strings.

### Implementation

- [inflate.ts]({{src_url}}inflate.ts)

## The `invoke` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-invoke.bgl.json" | board }}

Invokes (using "[run as component](/breadboard/docs/reference/runtime-semantics/#run-as-component-mode)" runtime mode) specified board, supplying remaining incoming wires as input ports for that board. Returns the outputs of the board as its own output ports.

Use this component to invoke another board from your board.

### Input ports

This component has a single static input port and multiple dynamic ports.

- **Board** (id: `$board`) -- required, a board to run. The board can be specified as a URL to the [BGL file](/breadboard/docs/concepts/#breadboard-graph-language-bgl), or as BGL directly.

- all other wired in ports are passed as the input values for the board.

### Output ports

The output ports of this component are the outputs of the invoked board.

### Example

In the board above, the `invoke` component is used to invoke this board:

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/example-simple-greeting.bgl.json" | board }}

Following the semantics of the "run as component" mode, all inputs of the invoked board are populated by the input ports of the `invoke` component input ports, and all outputs of the invoked board are passed as output ports.

> [!TIP]
> Note how "Name" and "Location" input ports, as well as the "Greeting" output ports pop up in the Visual Editor when the "Board" input port is populated. This is the key property of the "[run as component](/breadboard/docs/reference/runtime-semantics/#run-as-component-mode)" mode: the board API is declarative and can be statically described.

### Implementation

- [invoke.ts]({{src_url}}invoke.ts)

## The `map` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-map.bgl.json" | board }}

Given a list items and a board, runs the board in "[run as component](/breadboard/docs/reference/runtime-semantics/#run-as-component-mode)" mode for each item in the list. Similar in to JavaScript [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) function, except boards run in parallel.

When running the board, the `map` component will supply three inputs with these ids:

- `item` -- the item from the list
- `index` -- the index of the item in the list
- `list` -- the entire list.

This very is similar to the arguments of the JavaScript [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) function.

### Input ports

The component has two statically defined input ports:

- **Board** (id: `board`) -- required, a board to run. The board can be specified as a URL to the [BGL file](/breadboard/docs/concepts/#breadboard-graph-language-bgl), or as BGL directly.

- **List** (id: `list`) -- optional, an array of items to supply to the board as inputs.

### Output ports

The component has one statically defined output port:

- **List** (id: `list`) -- optional, an array of results from each board's run.

### Example

Given this board that creates a simple greeting given a name and location:

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/example-simple-greeting.bgl.json" | board }}

We can use the `map` component to print out a set of greetings for a bunch of people.

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-map.bgl.json" | board }}

> [!TIP]
> The [`curry`](#the-curry-component) component and `map` component often go hand in hand, just like in the example above. Currying provides a convenient way to pass unchanging arguments to the board that is being invoked multiple times via `map`.

### Implementation

- [map.ts]({{src_url}}map.ts)

## The `passthrough` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-passthrough.bgl.json" | board }}

This is a no-op component. It takes the input port values and passes them along as output port values, unmodified. Just like any [no-op statement](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)>) in programming, this component comes in handy in various situations, like when the board needs an entry point, but the rest of the board forms a cycle.

### Input ports

- any ports that are wired in.

### Output ports

- the mirror of the ports wired in.

### Implementation

- [passthrough.ts]({{src_url}}passthrough.ts)

## The `reduce` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-reduce.bgl.json" | board }}

Given a list, an initial accumulator value, and a board, invokes a board (runOnce) for each item and accumulator in the list and returns the final accumulator value. Loosely, same logic as the `reduce` function in JavaScript.

### Input ports

### Output ports

### Example

### Implementation

- [reduce.ts]({{src_url}}reduce.ts)

## The `runJavascript` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-run-javascript.bgl.json" | board }}

Use this component to execute JavaScript code. The component recognizes a required `code` input property, which is a string that contains the code to be executed. It also recognizes a `name` input property, which is a string that specifies the name of the function that will be invoked to execute the code. If not supplied, the `run` function name will be used.

All other input properties will be passed as arguments to the function.

The code is executed in a new V8 context in component or a Web Worker in the browser, which means that it cannot access any variables or functions from the outside.

The component will pass the result of the execution as the `result` output property.

### Input ports

- `code` - required, must contain the code to execute
- `name` - optional, must contain the name of the function to invoke (default: `run`)
- zero or more inputs that will be passed as arguments to the function.

### Output ports

- `result` - the result of the execution

### Example

If we send the following inputs to `runJavascript`:

```json
{
  "code": "function run() { return 1 + 1; }"
}
```

We will get this output:

```json
{
  "result": 2
}
```

If we send:

```json
{
  "code": "function run({ what }) { return `hello ${what}`; }",
  "what": "world"
}
```

We will get:

```json
{
  "result": "hello world"
}
```

### Implementation

- [run-javascript.ts]({{src_url}}run-javascript.ts)

## The `secrets` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-secrets.bgl.json" | board }}

Use this component to access secrets, such as API keys or other valuable bits of information that you might not want to store in the graph itself. The component takes in an array of strings named `keys`, matches the process environment values, and returns them as outputs. This enables connecting edges from environment variables.

### The input ports

- `keys` - required, must contain an array of strings that represent the keys to look up in the environment. If not supplied, empty output is returned.

### The output ports

- one output for each key that was found in the environment.

### Example

Use this component to pass the `PALM_KEY` environment variable to the `text-completion` component. The input:

```json
{
  "keys": ["PALM_KEY"]
}
```

Will produce this output:

```json
{
  "PALM_KEY": "<value of the API key from the environment>"
}
```

### Implementation

- [secrets.ts]({{src_url}}secrets.ts)

## The `service` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-service.bgl.json" | board }}

Represents an external service that can be used by the board. Useful for integrating external services with Breadboard.

### Input ports

![Service inputs](/breadboard/static/images/core-kit/service-inputs.png)

This component a single fixed "Service URL" configuration port, The endpoint at that URL must conform to [Breadboard Service Endpoint](/breadboard/docs/reference/bse/) (BSE) protocol.

Once the "Service URL" port is configured, Breadboard Visual Editor will ask the service to describe itself and use that description to supply additional input and output ports.

In the example above, the "Query" input port and "News" output port is created based on this description.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to Breadboard Service Endpoints being able to describe themselves, they also react to configured and wired inputs, making it possible to write services whose inputs and outputs change based their configuration.

### Output ports

The output ports are defined by the Breadboard Service Endpoint.

### Example

For a sample implementation of a BSE protocol, see the [Google News Service](https://www.val.town/v/dglazkov/googlenews) on [Valtown](https://val.town), which is used in the board above.

> [!TIP]
>
> [Valtown](https://val.town) is a quick and easy to create HTTP endpoints for Breadboard services.

### Implementation

- [service.ts]({{src_url}}service.ts)

## The `unnest` component

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-unnest.bgl.json" | board }}

### Input ports

### Output ports

### Example

### Implementation

- [unnest.ts]({{src_url}}unnest.ts)
