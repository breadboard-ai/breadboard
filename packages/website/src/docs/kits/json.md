{% assign src_url = "https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/tree/main/packages/json-kit/src/nodes/" %}

This kit contains the following nodes:

## schemish

Converts a given JSON schema to [Schemish](https://glazkov.com/2023/05/06/schemish/)

## validateJson

Validates given JSON against a given JSON Schema.

## jsonata

Use this node to execute [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) expressions. JSONata is a versatile JSON query language.

### Example

If we send the following inputs to `jsonata`:

```json
{
  "expression": "$join(items.snippet, '\n')",
  "json": {
    "items": [
      {
        "snippet": "Question: How old is planet Earth?"
      },
      {
        "snippet": "Thought: I wonder how old planet Earth is?"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We will get this output:

```json
{
  "result": "Question: How old is planet Earth?\nThought: I wonder how old planet Earth is?"
}
```

### Inputs

- `expression` -- required, a string that contains the JSONata expression to be executed.
- `raw` -- an optional boolean that specifies whether the result of the expression should be passed as-is (`true`), or it should be passed as the `result` output property (`false`, default).
- `json` -- an optional JSON object that will be used as the context for the expression. If `json` is not specified, the node will use the input property bag (minus `expression` and `raw`) as the context.

### Outputs:

- `result` -- the result of the expression, unless `raw` is `true`. In the latter case, the result is passed as-is.

### Implementation:

- [jsonata.ts]({{src_url}}jsonata.ts)

## The `xmlToJson` node

Use this node to convert XML to JSON. Most nodes in the starter kit are designed to work with JSON, so this node is useful when you have XML data.

This nodes takes one required `xml` property, which it treats as XML and converts to it to JSON as the `json` output property. The format of JSON follows the `alt-json` convention that is described in https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/json.

### Example

If we send the following inputs to `xml-to-json`:

```json
{
  "xml": "<root><question>How old is planet Earth?</question><thought>I wonder how old planet Earth is?</thought></root>"
}
```

We will get this output:

```json
{
  "json": {
    "root": {
      "question": { "$t": "How old is planet Earth?" },
      "thought": { "$t": "I wonder how old planet Earth is?" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Inputs:

- `xml` - required, must contain a string that represents XML.

### Outputs:

- `json` - the result of converting XML to JSON.

### Implementation:

- [xml-to-json.ts]({{src_url}}xml-to-json.ts)
