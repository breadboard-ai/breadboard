### Board

A _board_ is a kind of executable program, expressed declaratively as a graph.

### Nodes

A _node_ is a step in a board that performs some action. This might be calling
an external API, or executing some local computation. Nodes are similar to
functions in traditional programs.

### Ports

A _port_ is a named input or output of a node. Nodes can have any number of
ports. Ports can be _source ports_ (data flows _out_), or _destination ports_
(data flows _in_). Source ports are analogous to the parameters of a function.
Destination ports are analogous to the results returned by a function.

### Edges

An _edge_ is a connection between two ports through which data flows.

#### Optional edges

Edges can be _optional_, which means that the execution of a node will not wait
for data to be present before proceeding with execution.

#### Constant edges

Edges can be _constant_, which means the most recent object that flowed through
the edge will remain available indefinitely, instead of being destructively
consumed.

### Kits

A _kit_ is a library that provides graphs.

### Slots

Boards can have _slots_, which is Breadboard's way of expressing _inversion of
control_. When a board exposes a slot, it means that users of that board are
expected to provide an implementation for some portion of the graph themselves.

### Breadboard Graph Language (BGL)

Breadboard Graph Language (BGL) is a JSON file format format described by [this
JSON
schema](../../../schema/breadboard.schema.json).

### Runtimes

A _runtime_ is a system that executes boards. Current runtimes include: Node and
Web.

### Frontends

A _frontend_ is a system that generates boards. Current frontends include the
`@google-labs/breadboard` API for Node, a Python library (coming soon!), and the
Breadboard Visual Playground. Boards can also be written by hand directly as
JSON, but using a frontend is typically easier.

Note that frontends are never coupled to a specific runtime. Boards generated by
the Node API can be executed by any runtime.
