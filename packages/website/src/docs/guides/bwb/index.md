Welcome! Breadboard is the [open source project](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard) from Google Labs that aims to enable rapid prototyping of AI systems and unlock easy remixing and sharing of these prototypes.

> [!NOTE]
> This document is best used as part of the "Build with Breadboard" workshop. You may still find it useful outside of that purpose, but some instructions might not make sense.

Let‚Äôs get you started.

## Join the Community Board Server

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWMd1RpGKhw&list=PLH7s1qvZKUeLampPQdBggg8LK31heBTxk&index=1

> [!TIP]
> Videos (like the one above) will roughly have the same content as the text for each section, but may contain more information, primarily due to the actual person following the instructions and explaining them step by step.

For this workshop, you will be working on a community board server. To get access to the server:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to the spreadsheet provided by the workshop facilitators and find the username that you like and that hasn‚Äôt been claimed yet. To claim the username, enter your name and email address next to it.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Once you‚Äôve claimed the username, copy the associated Board Server API key. This key will serve as a password that lets you access the board server.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Once you have the Board Server API key, join the server by going to the Board Server URL, provided by facilitators.

You will see something like this:

![Welcome to Breadboard image](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image1.png)

Enter your Board Server API key and click ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go!‚Äù. If everything went well, you should see a little welcome toast at the bottom right of the screen:

![Welcome toast](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image2.png)

If you see this message, you‚Äôre in!

> [!NOTE]
> If you get an error message instead, double-check to make sure you‚Äôve entered the right key. If you‚Äôre still having trouble, reach out to the facilitator.

## Look around, explore the boards

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vDW510aGw&list=PLH7s1qvZKUeLampPQdBggg8LK31heBTxk&index=2&pp=iAQB

Now that you‚Äôre on the board server, click on this icon in the top left to open up the board menu:

![Board Menu Icon](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image13.png)

You should see something like this:

![Board Server menu](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image23.png)

Each item in this list is a board you can load and try out. The boards you create will be listed at the top, with boards shared by others listed below, labeled `@username` to help you see who made them.

We‚Äôve seeded the server with some initial boards that will be labeled with the `@shared` username. You can play with them.

> [!TIP]
> Once everyone starts to create their own boards, the list might get quite crowded. Use the ‚ÄúSearch Boards‚Äù box to narrow down the list. For instance, to find all the initial boards, type in `shared`. For more details on how to use the left-side menu, see ‚Äú[Boards and Providers](https://breadboard-ai.github.io/breadboard/docs/visual-editor/boards-and-providers/)‚Äù documentation.

Let‚Äôs open the "Chat with your dog" board and run it by clicking on the ‚ÄúDebug Board‚Äù button:

![Debug button](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image24.png)

You will see an activity log pane pop up and show you progress: what‚Äôs currently happening in the board. When the board needs your input, it will stop and ask for it in the activity pane:

![Activity Pane](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image25.png)

Enter your input and click the ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù button. Some boards, like the chat bot, will continue indefinitely until you stop them by hitting ‚ÄúStop Board‚Äù. Others will run to completion and finish.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to use the Activity pane see the ‚Äú[Activity Pane](https://breadboard-ai.github.io/breadboard/docs/visual-editor/activity-pane/)‚Äù chapter in Breadboard documentation.

> [!TIP]
> üåµ some of the screenshots in the docs are showing the previous-generation UI, but the basics of the pane are still the same.

## Remix a board

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dyN4TeaZv0&list=PLH7s1qvZKUeLampPQdBggg8LK31heBTxk&index=3&pp=iAQB

Let‚Äôs see if you can remix this board and turn "Chat with your dog" into ‚ÄúChat with your cat‚Äù.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open "Chat with your dog" board.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Click the little üíæ button:

![Board overflow menu](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image7.png)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Change the title to ‚ÄúChat with your Cat‚Äù in the ‚ÄúSave As‚Ä¶‚Äù dialog:

![Board details dialog](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image27.png)

After a few moments, a new tab will appear in the editor. This is your first board on this server. In addition to just running it, you can make changes to this board.

![Board tabs](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image28.png)

The first thing we‚Äôll do is change the persona of the bot to be a dog. To do so, click on the ‚ÄúPersona‚Äù port of the ‚ÄúDog‚Äù component:

![Edit Specialist Persona](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image29.png)

As you can see, this gives us a few different options to mess with. Let‚Äôs start by editing the ‚ÄúPersona‚Äù field and change it to:

```md
You are a friendly cat who loves to chat with humans
but on your own terms. You respond in short sentences,
often meowing, purring, hissing, or chirping.
You love to nap, eat, play with toys, and chase laser
pointers. You are also very curious and love to
explore new things. You might ask the human about
what they are doing, what they are eating, or
what they are wearing. You might also comment
on the weather, the time of day, or any noises
you hear.

You don't like being told what to do, so if the
human tries to command you or give you
instructions, you will ignore them or give them
a sassy reply. You are the boss!
```

> [!TIP]
> Prompts are a very important part of working with LLMs. The ‚ÄúPersona‚Äù field is the system instruction part of the prompt, and allows you to specify the ‚Äúwho‚Äù of the personality we‚Äôre looking for. The ‚ÄúTask‚Äù field is more about the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù: what is it that we want them to do.

To make it clear that this bot is now a cat, scroll up and change the title to ‚ÄúCat‚Äù:

![Edit Specialist](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image3.png)

Click the ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù button and then start the board by clicking ‚ÄúDebug Board‚Äù as we usually do.

You will now see that bot‚Äôs demeanor in the activity log is distinctly cat-like:

![Cat Bot Activity Log](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image4.png)

Woo hoo! We made our own cat bot.

One thing that‚Äôs jarring is the ‚ÄúTalk to your dog‚Äù instruction when we‚Äôre being asked to talk to what‚Äôs clearly a cat.

Let‚Äôs change that. Stop the board and then click on ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù port of the ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù component:

![Human Component View](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image5.png)

Now change it to ‚ÄúTalk to your cat‚Äù and click ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù.

![Edit Human Component](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image6.png)

When you run the board again, it will have the right instruction. Hooray, we did it. We remixed the board.

> [!TIP]
> This is roughly how board-making happens: we tweak and make changes and add new things until we have something that works like we want it to.

**üèãÔ∏è Challenge**: Try to come up with other kinds of personalities your users might enjoy chatting with and remix the chat bot into something else. Don‚Äôt forget to use ‚ÄúSave As‚Ä¶‚Äù to avoid accidentally overwriting the glorious cat bot with the new idea:

![The "Save As..." item in the overflow menu](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image7.png)

## Share your work

Now that you have a working board, let‚Äôs see if we can share it with others.

First, it is always a good idea to give the board a better description. To do so, choose the ‚ÄúEdit Board Details‚Äù option from the overflow menu above (or double-click on the board‚Äôs tab title)

![Board details dialog](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image8.png)

You can share this board in a couple of different ways:

**üé® Option 1: Share to collaborate**. Choose the option if you want to show your colleagues or friends the actual board that you built. Perhaps it will spark some ideas for them and let them remix it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxyIr67cA2k&list=PLH7s1qvZKUeLampPQdBggg8LK31heBTxk&index=4&pp=iAQB

To do so, select the ‚ÄúCopy Tab URL‚Äù option from the overflow menu:

![The "Copy Tab URL" menu option](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image9.png)

This will copy the URL of this tab into your clipboard, and now you can paste it wherever you want it to share. When your friends click on this link, they will be taken to the visual editor with the board tab open.

**üñºÔ∏è Option 2: Share as a Preview**. Choose this option if you want to share the board with potential users. A Preview is a mini-app that is automatically created for your board and it‚Äôs a great way to show off your work with peeps who don‚Äôt necessarily care how you built it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDGFBVU05Xc&list=PLH7s1qvZKUeLampPQdBggg8LK31heBTxk&index=5&pp=iAQB

This way takes a bit of preparation. The first step is always the same:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Select ‚ÄúCopy Preview URL‚Äù option from the overflow menu. This will copy the URL of the Preview to your clipboard. You can share this link right away, and whoever clicks on it will see something like this:

![The Preview](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image10.png)

This is the mini-app. It hides away all of the board editing stuff and wraps a nice UI around it.

By default, the mini-app will run in ‚Äúlocal mode‚Äù, where the user has to enter all the API keys themselves. If you‚Äôd like to allow your users to try the mini-app without having to do that, proceed to the next step.

2Ô∏è‚É£ This step is a one-time setup. Open a new browser tab and go to this URL. As in the step before, you will see something like this:

![The Preview](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image10.png)

Click on ‚ÄúSign in to Board Server‚Äù and enter your Board Server API key:

![Enter board server API key dialog](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image12.png)

Once you‚Äôve signed, in you should see new options in the left sidebar:

![Owner options in Preview sidebar](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image14.png)

You do not need to repeat this step for the next previews.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The final step is to create an invite link. Click the ‚ÄúManage Invites‚Äù option (if you don‚Äôt have it, go back to step 2).

![Manage Invites dialog](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image15.png)

Then click the ‚ÄúCreate an invite link‚Äù button. Doing so will generate a special link that you can share with others. When they use this link, they will be automatically given access to your Preview. Click the little clipboard icon to copy this link into your clipboard.

![Manage Invites with Link dialog](/breadboard/static/images/bwb/image16.png)

The link will typically look like this:

```url
https://breadboard-community.wl.r.appspot.com/boards/@username/chat-with-your-cat.bgl.app?invite=vrsgb9v0
```

You can also deactivate this invite link by clicking the little trash can icon. Once the invite has been deactivated, clicking on the invite link will direct the user to a ‚Äúlocal only‚Äù preview, where they have to enter all the API keys themselves.

## Beyond the basics

Once learned, Breadboard can be a rather powerful tool. To give you a sense of all the things possible with it, let‚Äôs look over all of the initial boards.
