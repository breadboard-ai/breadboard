This update is very ü•¶ (broccoli emoji). In our project, we use the term "broccoli" as the opposite of "ice cream". The latter is all about having fun and making cool stuff. The former is about cleaning up, documenting, and making the project more accessible and fun for others. Over the last 5-ish weeks, we've been [eating a lot of broccoli](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/issues/1818).

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Website

The most noticeable change since the last time we met would be on the [project Web site](https://breadboard-ai.github.io/breadboard/). It was truly the labor of love.

First, we've tech'd up our ability to show example boards. Why post a screenshot of a board, when we can just show the actual board:

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/librarian/final.bgl.json" | board }}

This ability to embed boards into the site is quite handy: now, every example of a component or a guide comes with its own set of boards that you can immediately run and play with.

### It's "Components" now

Wait... did I just say "Component?" What happened to "Node"? As we played with Breadboard, we realized that the term "node" is both a bit overloaded ("Node as in NodeJS? Or some other node?") and also is a bit farther from the terminology used by the actual breadboard enthusiasts.

So we picked another term: "Component". Yeah, it's also quite overloaded and overused, but at least it puts us back on track with our breadboard vernacular.

As part of us settling down on the terminology, we are now working lock on to three key terms in Breadboard: "component" (nee "node"), "kit", and "board" -- everywhere, in our docs, our code and the Visual Editor.

### Guides and more guides

The website now features several guides to help you get going with the Breadboard Visual Editor. There's one that takes you through the creation of a [Librarian](/breadboard/docs/guides/librarian/) agent, one that builds a [Social Post Generator](/breadboard/docs/guides/social-post/) with you, one that helps you build [your first tool](/breadboard/docs/guides/first-tool/), and even a guide for making your own [Novel Generator](/breadboard/docs/guides/novel-generator/).

Each guide comes with step-by-step instructions and snapshots of boards to help you play along. Give them a whirl and tell us what you think.

### Kit documentation

We've invested a substantial amount of ü•¶ time into writing docs for all Breadboard kits. We're still not 100% done, but we're close. Most components now have a simple example board that helps explain what it does. For instance, here's the example board for the [`promptTemplate` component](/breadboard/docs/kits/template/#the-prompttemplate-component):

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/template-prompt-template.bgl.json" | board }}

Component documentation is also reachable via the "Read More" link in the Visual Editor:

### Summer cleaning

We adjusted the look of the website to be more like the Visual Editor, as well as cleaned up existing docs and guides, archiving the ones that are no longer relevant. The [Breadboard Github repo](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard) got a bit of a spruce up, and now points (correctly) to the website.

## üöö Service Component

One of the cool additions to the [Core Kit](/breadboard/docs/kits/core/) is the [`service` component](/breadboard/docs/kits/core/#the-service-component). Think of it as an escape hatch, which allows quickly adding various external services to our boards. All the API has to do is follow the [Breadboard Service Endpoint protocol](/breadboard/docs/reference/bse/).

For example, here's a simple Google News service built using [Val town](https://www.val.town/) that is brought into a board. Now this board can search news!

{{ "/breadboard/static/boards/kits/core-service.bgl.json" | board }}

By the way, we here in Breadboard project **love** [Val town](https://www.val.town/). It's a perfect duct tape for our popsicle sticks, a necessary ingredient in any prototyping adventure.

## üèÑ Board Server

The board server, which was introduced in the [last month's update](/breadboard/updates/2024-06-10/#-board-server), is growing like a weed. We've been adding various new bits of functionality to it.

We taught it to communicate more about itself and the boards it serves, starting down the path of proper access controls. It now will report correctly whether or not the board belongs to you or someone else, and it will even hide boards that are marked as draft from others on the server.
