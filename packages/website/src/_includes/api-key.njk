<div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-note"><p class="markdown-alert-title">Note</p><p>You might have a reasonable question: "Why does Breadboard ask me for an API key?" One of the key tenets of this project is to allow makers quickly connect to various interesting models and other APIs. To do that, Breadboard has a pretty robust system for managing <em>secrets</em>: valuable pieces of data help you connect to them. To balance convenience with flexibility, Breadboard Visual Editor stores these keys in your local browser store.</p>
