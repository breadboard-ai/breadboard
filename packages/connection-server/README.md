A stateless service for coordinating authenticated connections between
Breadboard end-user clients and third-party apps/services using OAuth.

## Background

This README assumes knowledge of terms and concepts from [RFC 6749: The OAuth
2.0 Authorization Framework ](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749),
especially:

- [_authorization endpoint_](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1)
- [_authorization code_](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1)
- [_access token_](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.4)
- [_access token scope_](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.3)
- [_refresh token_](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.5)

Note the term _connection_ is not a standard OAuth term. We adopt this term to
refer to the high level process of an end-user "connecting" their client to a
third-party app/service.

## APIs

### `GET list/`

List the available connections.

Returns a list of all possible third-party apps/services that the end-user could
connect their Breadboard client to. See [Configuration Connections](#configuring-connections) for where this list comes from.

Each connection includes an ID (allowing us to distinguish between the various
available connections), a display name and description, and a third-party
[authorization
endpoint](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1) URL.

<!-- To initiate a connection, the end-user shall be navigated to the authorization
endpoint URL. The authorization endpoint URL is operated by the particular
app/service (so, it's not something we deal with directly in this server), and
is responsible for authenticating, prompting for permission, and (if permission
is granted) generating an authorization code. -->

### `GET grant/`

Perform first-time authorization for a connection.

Takes a connection ID and a temporary [authorization
code](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) (generated by
the third-party authorization endpoint and returned to the end-user via a
redirect).

Returns an [access
token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.4) which can be
used to access third-party resources, an expiry duration for that access token,
and a long-term [refresh
token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.5) which can be
used to automatically acquire new access tokens without user interaction.

### `GET refresh/`

Get a new authorization token for when an earlier one has expired.

Takes a connection ID and a refresh token. Returns a new access token and expiry
duration.

## Configuring Connections

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, connections will also be configurable via the Google Cloud
> [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs).

Connections are configured by placing a JSON file in this package's `secrets/`
folder, and setting the `CONNECTIONS_FILE` environment variable to its path. The
format of the JSON file follows this example:

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "id": "cool-service",
      "title": "Cool Service",
      "description": "A cool service for doing cool stuff",
      "oauth": {
        "client_id": "an_oauth_client_id",
        "client_secret": "the_secret_for_this_oauth_client",
        "scopes": ["an_oauth_scope"],
        "auth_uri": "https://example.com/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://example.com/token"
      },
      "icon": "data:image/png;base64,some_base64_bytes_of_a_png"
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Connection configuration files should never be checked into GitHub or any
> other insecure location.
>
> This is because the `client_secret` field is highly sensitive. It allows any
> party to impersonate the application it belongs to and intercept user access
> tokens. The Breadboard Connection Server never reveals this secret over its
> APIs, and protecting these secrets is the primary reason this server exists.

### Configuring Google Cloud Connections

To configure a connection for a Google Cloud project:

1. Follow the documentation at [Google Identity > OpenID
   Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
   to create and configure an OAuth 2.0 client.

2. Download the OAuth 2.0 client's JSON configuration with the button shown
   here:

   <img src="./docs/gcp-client-secrets.png" width="480px" height="229px" alt="Screenshot of the &quot;Client secrets&quot; section of the Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client detail page with the &quot;Download JSON&quot; button highlighted">

3. Copy the the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `auth_uri`, and `token_uri` fields from this file
   into the `CONNECTIONS_FILE` you have chosen (see above for example).

## Local development

```sh
cd breadboard/packages/connection-server
npm run dev
```

This will start the server on `localhost:5555`. Set the `HOST` and/or `PORT`
environment variables to customize the address. The server will automatically
restart if its implementation or connection configuration files are modified.
