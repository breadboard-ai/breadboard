# Breadboard Board Server Reference Implementation

## Running tests

To run the tests:

```
npm run test
npm run test:integration
```

## Choosing a storage backend

The board server can be run with different storage backends. The default is `firestore`, but you can also run it with `sqlite`.

To run locally with `sqlite`:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=n/a
export STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite
export SQLITE_DB_PATH=/path/to/board-server.db
```

## Building with docker

The board server can be run as a self-contained docker image.

To build the container with the `sqlite` backend:

```
docker build --build-arg STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite --build-context breadboard=../../ -t board-server:sqlite .
```

This container will use `sqlite` as a storage backend. It will keep its state in a file called `board-server.db` inside the working directory on the container.

To build the container with the `firestore` backend:

```
docker build --build-arg STORAGE_BACKEND=firestore --build-context breadboard=../../ -t board-server:firestore .
```

This container will use `firestore` backend and connect to Google Cloud Firestore database.

More than likely, in either case you will want to specify the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` build argument:

```sh
docker build --build-arg ALLOWED_ORIGINS="list of visual editor urls" ...`
```

When building on Apple Silicon, use `platform` flag to specify the right platform:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 ...
```

To run the container:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name board-server board-server
docker exec -it board-server /bin/bash
# npm run add <username> # add a user and copy your API key
```

## Deploying container on Cloud Run

[Create repository](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/create-repos#create-console)

Run credential helper:

```sh
 gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

Get the full image name. See [Tagging the local image](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling#tag) for details.

Tag the local image with the repository name:

```sh
docker tag source-image image-name
```

Push image to repository

```sh
docker push image-name
```

Deploy to Cloud Run:

```sh
gcloud run deploy service-name --image image-name
```

## Express server
You will need to set the appropriate storage backend for the board-server. To run locally with `sqlite`:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=n/a
export STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite
export SQLITE_DB_PATH=/path/to/board-server.db
```

Then, start the Express server:
```
npm run express
```

To create an account (and generate an API key), then - from the root of the `board-server` package - run the following command:
```
# npm run add <username> # add a user and copy your API key
```

## Firestore & App Engine deployment

Uses Firestore. Deploys to App Engine.

You will need to get ADC going to make Firestore work:

One-time setup:

- Login

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

```bash
gcloud config set project <project name>
```

- Create App Engine App in Cloud Console

- [Enable Firestore API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/firestore.googleapis.com)

- [Create Firestore database](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases) named "board-server"

Then, to run locally, from the root of the repo:

```bash
npm run s
```

This will bring up the board server at `http://localhost:3000` and
a breadboard-web dev server at whatever port it launches (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).

To deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build the project and deploy it to App Engine.

## Using secrets

If you wish to run boards on the server, you will need to store secrets on the board server.

Currently, there are two choices: using [Google Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/secret-manager?hl=en) and using the `secrets.json` file.

The choice is based on the value of the `STORAGE_BACKEND` variable.

If the value is `sqlite`, the `secrets.json` file will be used to retrieve the secrets.

If the value is `firestore`, the Google Cloud Secret Manager will be used.

Each secret must contain three pieces of information:

- **name**, such as `GEMINI_KEY`. This name should match the key that the boards use to ask for this secret.

- **value** -- the value of the secret.

- **origin** -- the associated [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) of the key. The secrets are most often used to gain access to various service APIs. To ensure that only those services can see their secret, the secrets are bound to the origin of the service.

### Storing secrets with `secrets.json`

At the root of the repository, place the file named `secrets.json`.

The file format is as follows:

```json
{
  "SECRET_NAME_GOES_HERE": {
    "secret": "SECRET_VALUE_GOES_HERE",
    "origin": "origin/of/secret/consumer/goes/here"
  }
}
```

For example:

```json
{
  "GEMINI_KEY": {
    "secret": " ...value elided..",
    "origin": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"
  }
}
```

### Storing secrets with Google Cloud Secret Manager

Store secrets in the Secret Manager per [GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/creating-and-accessing-secrets).

For each secret, add annotation named `origin` to specify the origin of secret consumer.
