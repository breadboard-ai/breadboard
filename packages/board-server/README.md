# Board Server Reference Implementation

Uses Firestore. Deploys to App Engine.

You will need to get ADC going to make Firestore work:

One-time setup:

- Login

````bash
gcloud auth login
```b

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
````

```bash
gcloud config set project <project name>
```

- Create App Engine App in Cloud Console

- Enable Firestore API

- Create Firestore database named "board-server"

Then, to run locally, from the root of the repo:

```bash
npm run s
```

This will bring up the board server at `http://localhost:3000` and
a breadboard-web dev server at whatever port it launches (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).
