# Breadboard Node Proxy Server

A library that allows running nodes remotely.

This is a very simple implementation of a Breadboard node proxy server. The
purpose of a node proxy server is to run Breadboard nodes individually, usually
as part of a run elsewhere.

In this example, some nodes are handled in the browser, and some are handled using this proxy server.

### To deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
