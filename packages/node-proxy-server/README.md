# Sample node proxy server

This is a very simple implementation of a Breadboard node proxy server. The
purpose of a node proxy server is to run Breadboard nodes individually, usually
as part of a run elsewhere. In this example, some nodes are run in the browser,
and some are run using this proxy server.

### To deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### To serve locally

npm run serve
```
