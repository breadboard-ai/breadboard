# Welcome to your Breadboard starter project

Run `npm run dev` to start the Breadboard development server.

This will start up a server that you can browse to. When you open the browser it will show you a simple UI that you can use to run and test the boards that you create directly in the browser.

You can create and edit boards directly in the `recipes` folder. These will automatically build and be available in then be available in the UI.

You can also run the recipes directly on the command line with `npm run recipe <path-to-recipe>`.
