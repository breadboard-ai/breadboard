# Welcome to your Breadboard starter project

The simplest way to start is to use the Breadboard UI. You can do this by running `npm run debug` and then opening the browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

You can create and edit boards directly in the `boards/` folder and the changes will be automatically built and be available in the UI.

## Running the boards from the command line

You can also run the boards directly on the command line with `npm run board --board=<path-to-board>`.

By default the `npm run board` command will include a number of the default kits (e.g, `@google-labs/core-kit`), if you want to use some custom kits, then you can add them to the command line with `npm run board --board=<path-to-board> -- --kit <kit-name> --kit <kit-name>`.
