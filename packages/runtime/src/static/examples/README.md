## Overview

These examples show real-world usage patterns for the Breadboard runtime static execution system. Each example is self-contained and demonstrates specific features and best practices.

## Quick Start

All examples can be run with TypeScript/Node.js:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run an example
npx tsx examples/basic-orchestration.ts
```
