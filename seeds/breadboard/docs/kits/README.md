# Breadboard Kits

Breadboard Kits are the best way to import functionality when building your applications.

They are _"tool**kits**"_ for functionality, convenience wrappers to create nodes for your board.  As such, they will be a critical part of anything you're building.

* See how to use a kit by going through [the breadboard tutorial](../tutorial/)
* See what's available in our [gallery of kits](./gallery-of-kits.md)
* See how to [build a kit](./build-a-kit.md) or use existing npm [libraries as kits](./libraries-as-kits.md)
* Did you build a useful kit?  Send us a pull request.
