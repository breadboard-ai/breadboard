# Note: workflow_run ALWAYS runs in the context of the default branch (main),
# not the PR branch. This is a GitHub security feature that ensures:
# 1. The workflow code being executed is from main (trusted code)
# 2. Secrets are available (they're not available to fork PRs in pull_request trigger)
# 3. Write permissions can be safely granted
