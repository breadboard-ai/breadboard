    # Use a cooldown to wait for updates to become stable before applying them.
    # This helps to mitigate npm attacks, because the more time has elapsed
    # since an attack was published, the more likely it has been discovered and
    # removed. Major and minor updates are also further slowed to reduce churn
    # and review time.
    #
    # Note that known security updates always bypass this cooldown.
